**dosbox-staging** is an attempt to revitalize DOSBox's development process.
It's not a rewrite, but a continuation and improvement on the existing DOSBox
codebase while leveraging modern development tools and practices.

## Goals

- Improve the **out-of-the-box** experience for new users.
- Encourage **new contributors** by removing barriers to entry.
- Fix, cleanup, and integrate a number of notable **community-developed
  patches** that are not included in the SourceForge-hosted project.
- Implement **new features** and quality-of-life improvements.
- Prioritize **DOS gaming**, while welcoming general improvements (such as for
  productivity software) that don't impact game emulation quality or
  code-maintainability.
- Strike a balance between emulation **quality**, **speed**, and **usability**.
- Deliver a consistent cross-platform experience.
- Leverage ongoing DOSBox development.
- Focus on supporting up-to-date, current Operating Systems and modern
  hardware.

A summary of technical and feature differences is
[here](https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging#summary-of-differences-compared-to-upstream).

Planned features are recorded in
[the backlog](https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging/projects/3).

## Non-goals

- Supporting old platforms such as Windows 9x, OS/2, and Mac OS X 10.4
  (and earlier).  If you want to run DOSBox on retro platforms, then
  your best bet is to use [DOSBox](https://www.dosbox.com/).

- Perfecting DOS-era hardware emulation. The
  [PCem](https://pcem-emulator.co.uk/) and
  [DOSBox-X](https://github.com/joncampbell123/dosbox-x) projects prioritize
  this goal.

- Being the fastest DOS emulator on x86 hardware. Users interested in
  emulation speed should look at
  [dosemu2](https://github.com/dosemu2/dosemu2).

- Acting as a general-purpose DOS operating system. For that, there's
  [FreeDOS](https://www.freedos.org/).


## Relationship to DOSBox

**dosbox-staging** is separate from and not supported by the SourceForge-hosted
[DOSBox](https://www.dosbox.com/) project or its development team, the DOSBox
Team.

We acknowledge and are thankful for the work shared by all DOSBox
contributors.

## Team

This project is maintained by the [dosbox-staging
team](https://github.com/orgs/dosbox-staging/people).
