**DOSBox Staging** is an attempt to revitalize DOSBox's development process
by applying modern development practices to the existing DOSBox codebase.

## Goals

- Improve the **out-of-the-box** experience for new users.
- Encourage **new contributors** by removing barriers to entry.
- Implement **new features** and quality-of-life improvements.
- Fix, cleanup, and integrate notable **community-developed patches** that
  fill valuable general-purpose and/or gaming-focused emulation holes
  (provided they don't impact broader compatibility, performance, stability,
  or code maintainability).
- Prioritize the **quality** of newly written code to minimize technical
  debt and ease future maintenance, which generally means
  following the [Staging Coding Style Guide](https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#coding-style)
  and being aware of best practices, like the [C++ Core Guidelines](http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines).
- Deliver a consistent cross-platform experience.
- Leverage upstream and community developments in DOSBox.
- Focus on supporting up-to-date, current Operating Systems and modern
 hardware.

A summary of technical and feature differences is
[here](https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging#summary-of-differences-compared-to-upstream).

We plan to add the features listed in
[the backlog](https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging/projects/3).

## Non-goals

- Supporting old operating systems (Windows 9x/Me, OS/2, and Mac OS X 10.4)
  and limited CPU/memory hardware, which are constraints [DOSBox](https://www.dosbox.com/)
  continues to support.

- Supporting the use of Windows 9x/Me in the emulator. Windows 9x/Me emulation
  is supported by projects such as [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/),
  although DOSBox forks like [DOSBox-X](https://www.dosbox-x.com/) and [DOSBox Pure](https://github.com/schellingb/dosbox-pure) also support this.

- Persuing hardware accuracy when it impacts the above goals or detracts
  from the source material. [PCem](https://pcem-emulator.co.uk/) and its derivatives
  like [86Box](https://86box.net) and [PCBox](https://pcbox.github.io/) are examples of cycle-accurate emulators.

- Being the fastest DOS emulator on x86 hardware. Linux users interested in
  emulation speed should look at [dosemu2](https://github.com/dosemu2/dosemu2).

- Acting as a general-purpose DOS operating system. For that, there is
  [FreeDOS](https://www.freedos.org/).

## Relationship to DOSBox

**DOSBox Staging** is separate from and not supported by the SourceForge-hosted
[DOSBox](https://www.dosbox.com/) project or its development team, the DOSBox
Team.

We acknowledge and are thankful for the work shared by all DOSBox
contributors.

## Team

This project is maintained by the
[DOSBox Staging team](https://github.com/orgs/dosbox-staging/people).
