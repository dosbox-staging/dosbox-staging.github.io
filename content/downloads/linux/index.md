## Tarball download

TODO: **RC1 build not released yet**
<!-- **[Download dosbox-staging 0.75.0-rc1](/)** -->

Our pre-compiled builds run on most Linux distributions (x86\_64 only for now).
They depend on the following easy-to-install packages, as follows:

#### Fedora

    sudo dnf install SDL2 SDL2_net opusfile

#### Ubuntu (18.04 or newer) and Debian (10 or newer)

    sudo apt install libsdl2-2.0 libsdl2-net-2.0 libopusfile0

#### Arch, Manjaro

    sudo pacman -S sdl2 sdl2_net opusfile


## Development snapshot builds

You can always see what's cooking on the master branch :)

These builds might be slow or unstable as they are designed with developers
and testers in mind: [download instructions for snapshot builds](
https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging#development-snapshot-builds).
