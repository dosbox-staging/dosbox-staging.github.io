[0_75_1]: https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging/releases/download/v0.75.1/dosbox-staging-macOS-v0.75.1.dmg

Compatible only with macOS 10.15 (Catalina).

*macOS uses its Gatekeeper feature to prevent users from running
externally-hosted 3rd party software, such as dosbox-staging. See [the section
below](#apple-gatekeeper) to learn how to fix it.*

### Homebrew

The build is also available via
[Homebrew package](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/dosbox-staging).

    brew install dosbox-staging


### Development snapshot builds

You can always see what's cooking on the master branch :)

These builds might be slow or unstable as they are designed with developers and
testers in mind: [download instructions for snapshot builds](/downloads/devel/).


### <a name="apple-gatekeeper" href="#apple-gatekeeper">ยง</a> Apple Gatekeeper

**Ctrl-click** (or right-click) on dosbox-staging app, and select "Open".
This time, Gatekeeper will show "Open" button like this:

#### Explanation

Apple's Gatekeeper feature only permits the running of notarized software, one
aspect of which involves developers making yearly payments to Apple.

As dosbox-staging is a volunteer effort, we are not in a position to make such
payments and therefore ask users to bypass Apple's Gatekeeper manually.
