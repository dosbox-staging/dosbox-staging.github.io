TODO: **RC1 build not released yet**
<!-- **[Download dosbox-staging 0.75.0-rc1](/)** -->

Compatible only with macOS 10.15 (Catalina); if you want to run it on an older
macOS, [build dosbox-staging yourself straight from the source][1] (send us
patches if you improve something!) :)

*macOS uses its Gatekeeper feature to prevent users from running
externally-hosted 3rd party software, such as dosbox-staging. See [the section
below](#apple-gatekeeper) to learn how to fix it.*

### Development snapshot builds

You can always see what's cooking on the master branch :)

These builds might be slow or unstable as they are designed with developers and
testers in mind: [download instructions for snapshot
builds](https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging#development-snapshot-builds).


### Older builds

There are no stable builds yet.


### <a name="apple-gatekeeper"></a> Apple Gatekeeper

Apple's Gatekeeper feature only permits the running of notarized software, one aspect of which involves developers making yearly payments to Apple. As dosbox-staging is a volunteer effort, we are not in a position to make such payments and therefore ask users to bypass Apple's Gatekeeper using either of the following methods:

#### Method 1

Use Linux instead. [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) is an excellent
choice for new users.

#### Method 2

The following screenshots depict how to manually approve dosbox-staging in
your security settings:
