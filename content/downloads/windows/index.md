TODO: **RC1 build not released yet**
<!-- **[Download dosbox-staging 0.75.0-rc1](/)** -->

*If Windows 8.x or Windows 10 prevents you from running dosbox-staging via
Microsoft Defender SmartScreen, see the [section below](#ms-ss).*

### Development snapshot builds

You can always see what's cooking on the master branch :)

These builds might be slow or unstable as they are designed with developers
and testers in mind: [download instructions for snapshot builds](
https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging#development-snapshot-builds).

### Older builds

There are no stable builds yet.

### <a name="ms-ss"></a> Microsoft Defender SmartScreen

Starting in Windows 8, Microsoft's SmartScreen pop-up encumbers the execution
of all but certified applications, a process that involves developers paying
Microsoft's certification vendors a yearly fee (such as Symantecâ€™s $795/year EV
Code Signing service).

As dosbox-staging is a volunteer effort, we are not in a position to make such
payments. We therefore ask users to manually unblock dosbox-staging and be
patient while Microsoft's "Application Reputation" scheme eventually whitelists
dosbox-staging (see: [[3]], and the last paragraph in [[4]]).

For now, user can bypass SmartScreen using methods 1, 2, or 3 below:

If you're concerned about downloading pre-compiled binaries, you can [build
dosbox-staging yourself straight from the source][5] (send us patches if you
improve something!) :).

#### Method 1

Use Linux instead. [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) is an excellent
choice for new users.

#### Method 2

SmartScreen will allow you to run application, after you click
on "More info":
