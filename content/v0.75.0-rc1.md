Installation instructions:

- [Linux](/downloads/linux/) (or [Steam on Linux](/downloads/linux#steam))
- [Windows](/downloads/windows/)
- [macOS](/downloads/macos/)

This release is significant for several reasons:

1. Our first stable build - from this point forward, builds named
   0.75.x will only contain bugfixes.

2. Start of the new development cycle for the next release - we have a number
   of planned features lined up already.

3. The first packages we offer for download through the new project home
   page - users won't need to have GitHub account to access our builds 
   any more.

There's no human-readable changelog just yet - there are [~1500 commits][diff]
to comb through. Hopefully, within a couple of days, we'll be able to write
a nice summary with a description of new features, improvements, and bugfixes.

In the meantime, we invite everyone to start testing RC1 builds; there are
some rough edges for sure - if you find any bugs, please report them in
[our bugtracker][bugtracker]. You can also ask questions on the
**#dosbox&#8209;staging** channel in [Luxtorpeda Discord Server][discord].

This release includes all upstream changes until SVN r4336, and 857 Git commits
on top of that.

Have fun! :)
