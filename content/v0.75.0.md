date = 2020-05-03
+++

**dosbox-staging** is a [soft-fork][1] of DOSBox (which is a separate project,
with its own schedule and development priorities).  We acknowledge and are
thankful for the work shared by all DOSBox contributors.  Changes originating
from DOSBox are clearly marked as "SVN".

## Abstract

These release notes summarize the changes made since the project's inception
through to the release of dosbox-staging 0.75. This includes:

- feature changes, including those added and removed
- known issues
- workflow changes visible to contributors

- [3. Changelog](#changelog)
  - [3.1. dosbox-staging](#changelog-git)
  - [3.2. Community patches and libraries](#changelog-libs)
  - [3.3. DOSBox](#changelog-svn)

One of apparent effects of this change is introduction of new `output` mode (named
`texture`), which uses SDL 2D-accelerated drawing API with one of platform-specific
backends.

For example, Windows users can use:
```
[sdl]
output           = texture
texture_renderer = direct3d11
```

macOS users can try Metal:
```
[sdl]
output           = texture
texture_renderer = metal
```

and everyone can use OpenGL as texture backend:
```
[sdl]
output           = texture
texture_renderer = opengl
```

Or just use `texture_renderer = auto` to pick the backend appropriate for your
Operating System.

## Support FLAC, Opus, and MP3 CD-DA tracks

TODO

## Pixel-perfect scaling mode

Pixel-perfect mode is integer-scaling mode, that preserves original artwork
without *any* blurriness.

This is an opt-in option, use following setting in config `sdl` section to test it:

```
output = texturepp
```

On 1080p screen it looks like this:

## Resizable window

TODO

## AUTOTYPE command

`AUTOTYPE` performs scripted keyboard entry into the running DOS program.

It can be used to reliably skip intros, answer Q&A style questions that some
games ask on startup, or conduct a simple demo.

Run this command to read usage:
```
Z:>\autotype
```

Some examples are listed in [dedicated wiki article][autotype].

## Changed defaults

TODO

## New mouse control methods

TODO

## Nuked OPL v1.8

A excellent [OPL3][opl] "Nuked" emulator is used by default. This change improves
AdLib and SoundBlaster music emulation accuracy in many games.

Improved emulation quality comes at a small cost of higher CPU usage. For the
vast majority of users it will not be a problem, but e.g. Raspberry Pi enthusiasts
might prefer to switch to one of older emulators (see documentation for `oplemu` in
the configuration file).

TODO: data?

## CONFIG command improvements

Built-in `CONFIG` shell command is old, but a little-known feature allowing user to
reconfigure dosbox at runtime.  This is a nifty way to change configuration using
e.g. batch scripts based on user input.

#### Reloading key bindings

User can now change key bindings at runtime by loading them from a file:

    Z:\>config -set "sdl mapperfile=<path-to-file>"


#### Other new options (SVN)

Upstream added a number of features to this command, to list them all run:

    Z:\>config /?


## Configuration file locations

#### Linux

The path for configuration files was changed according to
[XDG Base Directory Specification][xdg]. This means dosbox-staging is not going
to create configuration directories directly in your home directory any more.

Configuration files are created in:

    ~/.config/dosbox/

Users can override it via `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, according to [spec][xdg].

[xdg]: https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html

#### macOS

The path was slightly changed to avoid spaces in the default configuration
filename and group all configuration files in a single directory:

    ~/Library/Preferences/DOSBox/

#### Windows

*No changes; the configuration files are created in:*

    C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\DOSBox\


## 64-bit dynarec (SVN)

DOSBox had [dynamic recompilation][dynarec] support for a long time, but it was
limited only to 32-bit builds.  Support for 64-bit dynarec improves CPU emulation
speed and quality across the board - this is especially visible to Linux and macOS
users<sup>＊</sup>.

{{ youtube(id="9N-wXIamSh4", class="youtube") }}

Stargunner (1996) freeware; running on Linux x86\_64 via Boxtron

*Before 64-bit dynarec, this game had serious emulation problems resulting in
fluctuating emulation speed (sometimes too fast, sometimes too slow - regardless of
cycles settings). This game was designed to run with constant 70FPS and now it
runs with constant 70FPS.*

[dynarec]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_recompilation

<sup>
＊ - dosbox-staging v0.75.0 stable Windows build is still 32-bit; Linux and
macOS builds are 64-bits.
</sup>

### DATE and TIME commands (SVN)

Commands emulating DOS `DATE` and `TIME` utilities were added. User can
change date inside a dosbox:

```
Z:\>date
Current date: Fri 05/01/2020
Type ´date MM-DD-YYYY´ to change.
Z:\>time
Current time: 11:08:23,34
```

This feature is useful for running old batch scripts and bypassing date checks
in some old software.


## CGA improvements

[![CGA modes comparison](/cga-showcase-1-min.png)][cga4]

[cga4]:/cga-showcase-1.png

Maniac Mansion (1987), with forced CGA mode

- *top-left: CGA, default palette*
- *top-right: CGA/mono, green tint selected*
- *bottom-left: CGA Composite, early model, default hue*
- *bottom-right: CGA Composite, late model, default hue*

#### CGA monochrome mode

Some [CGA][cga] games from 80's look much better with monochrome display;
this mode is designed to emulate such setup.

Use `machine = cga_mono`

*User can switch between green, amber, white, and paperwhite tints at
runtime using&nbsp;F11.*

[cga]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_Graphics_Adapter

#### CGA Composite mode (SVN)

[Composite][comp] mode to  CGA emulation was introduced in SVN very
long time ago (in 2012), but was never backported to any stable release.
Most users know this mode from other DOSBox forks.

User can switch between Color and Composite mode, between CGA early and late
models, and adjust hue (all at runtime).

*The default keyboard binds for manipulating CGA modes conflict with
other essential binds. It's advisable to change them, if you plan to play
with this. The default key for turning on composite is F12.*

## GLSL shader support (SVN)

[GLSL][glsl] shaders provide a HW-accelerated alternative to old (software-based)
DOSBox "scalers". They also allow for

## Mount overlay support (SVN)

TODO


# <a name="removed" href="#removed">§</a> Removed features

- dosbox-staging does not run on OS/2 or derivatives.
- dosbox-staging does not run on Windows older than XP.
- Removed support for old DirectDraw (`ddraw`) output.  
  Use `output = texture`, `texture_renderer = directx11` instead.
- Removed support for old `overlay` output. Use any other output.
- Removed support for relative window size (`windowresolution = X%`).
- Removed support for 64-bit ZMBV codec (old 32-bit codec still works).
- Removed support for CD Digital Audio playback from physical disks.
  It is still possible to install games distributed on CDs by mounting them
  as directories. See [#260][260].

[260]: https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging/issues/260

# <a name="known-issues" href="#known-issues">§</a> Known issues

- Inconsistent minimum window size with `windowresolution = resizable` when
  leaving fullscreen.
- Windows, macOS: Window content is not refreshed when resizing.
- Windows, macOS: Emulation stops when moving or resizing window.
- Linux: Wayland crashes (Wayland support is "experimental" at the moment)
- Linux: Splash screen is sometimes transparent or corrupted on KDE

# <a name="devel-features" href="#devel-features">§</a> Workflow changes (for testers and developers)

- Repository was migrated from SVN to Git, preserving all publically
  available project history.
  Active SVN branch paths were imported as Git branches (named`svn/<branch-name>`).
  SVN tag paths were imported as Git lightweight tags (named `svn/<tag-name>`).
- Ongoing upstream SVN development work is being imported in a timely manner
  to the Git branch named `svn/trunk`.
- Implemented Continuous Integration system, covering 3&nbsp;Operating Systems
  (Linux, Windows, macOS), multiple architectures (x86, x86\_64, ARM, S390x,
  ppc64le), and multiple build configurations.
- Implemented build jobs for performing static code analysis (Clang,
  Coverity, PVS-Studio).
- Implemented build jobs for performing dynamic code analysis, covering
  multiple sanity checks (Clang UB sanitizer, GCC UB and Address sanitizers).
- CI includes gating mechanism to prevent introduction of new compiler
  warnings, static, or dynamic analysis issues. This makes code
  review process much easier.
- Windows: buildsystem was adjusted to allow easy compilation, without
  manual download or patching of dependencies. We use `vcpkg` for to manage
  libraries. The solution file was fixed to work with Visual Studio 2019.
- Linux, macOS: a number of small buildsystem improvements.
- Automatic release builds (development snapshots). These builds allow testers
  to verify new features and bugfixes without forcing them to compile
  themselves.
 
TODO describe

- Established clear contributing rules
- Notable reduction in static analysis issues
- Notable reduction in compile-time warnings
