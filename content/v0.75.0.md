## <a name="introduction" href="#introduction">§</a> Introduction

This document contains the release notes for dosbox-staging 0.75. It describes
recently added, changed, or deleted features of dosbox-staging.

All users are encouraged to consult the ***New Features in Detail*** and
***Known Issues*** sections before using dosbox-staging, as these describe
important interface changes as well as information discovered late in the
release cycle or after the release.

## <a name="new-features" href="#new-features">§</a> New Features in Detail

New features originating from our upstream (DOSBox) are marked with "**SVN**".

### <a name="sdl2" href="#sdl2">§</a> Upgrade to SDL 2.0

SDL 2.0 is a major update to the SDL 1.2 codebase, which has been unmaintained
since 2013. SDL 2.0 supports more input devices; more output interfaces such as
Wayland, and OpenGLES 1 and 2; low-latency audio using OpenSL ES; and improves
cross-platform consistency.

The migration to SDL 2.0:

- dropped 3,211 lines of SDL 1.2 code in place of 1,664 lines, for just
  under a 50% reduction in code-size.
- eliminated several OS-specific branches and all SDL1-specific kludges.
- eased support for modern graphic APIs, and opened the field for new features
  and improvements.

One example includes the new `texture` `output` mode, which uses SDL's 2D
hardware-accelerated API rendering to a platform-specific backend.

For example, Windows users can use:

``` ini
[sdl]
output           = texture
texture_renderer = direct3d11
```

macOS users can try Metal:

``` ini
[sdl]
output           = texture
texture_renderer = metal
```

and everyone can use OpenGL as texture backend:

``` ini
[sdl]
output           = texture
texture_renderer = opengl
```

Or just use `texture_renderer = auto` to let SDL pick the backend appropriate
for your Operating System.

## <a name="cdda" href="#cdda">§</a> Support FLAC, Opus, and MP3 CD-DA tracks

FLAC, Opus, and MP3 (as well as MP2 and MP1)-encoded audio can be `imgmount`ed
as CD-DA tracks in dosbox-staging, in addition to the usual WAV and Vorbis
tracks supported by DOSBox. WAV support has been expanded to include Sony's
Wave64 format.

dosbox-staging also supports tracks having sample resolutions of 24 and 16-bit;
sampling rates of 96, 88.2, 48, 44.1, 22.05, and 11.025 kHz; and stereo or mono
channel counts (to the extent each codec supports these variations). You can
mix-and-match these properties and track types to best suit each track's
content.

The following sample CUE file depicts the use of every codec supported by dosbox-staging:

``` cue
FILE "data.iso" BINARY
  TRACK 01 MODE1/2048
    INDEX 01 00:00:00

FILE "track02.opus" OPUS
  TRACK 02  AUDIO
    PREGAP 00:02:00
    INDEX 01 00:00:00

FILE "track03.flac" FLAC
  TRACK 03 AUDIO
    INDEX 01 00:00:00

FILE "track04.mp3" MP3
  TRACK 04 AUDIO
    INDEX 01 00:00:00

FILE "track05.w64" W64
  TRACK 05 AUDIO
    INDEX 01 00:00:00

FILE "track06.ogg" OGG
  TRACK 06 AUDIO
    INDEX 01 00:00:00

FILE "track07.wav" WAV
  TRACK 07 AUDIO
    INDEX 01 00:00:00
```

For devices with sufficient storage, we recommend ripping your CD-ROM audio to
(lossless) FLAC tracks and adding seek-points using:

``` shell
flac -8 --output-name=trackXY.flac trackXY.wav
metaflac --add-seekpoint=1s trackXY.flac
```

FLAC typically achieves between 50% and 35% compression while producing
binary-identical output versus WAV files.

For limited-storage devices such as ARM single-board computers, Opus provides
state-of-the-art lossy compression that exceeds all other formats including
Apple's AAC and AAC High-Efficiency formats. Opus allows even further space
savings over MP3 or Vorbis track, while matching or exceeding them in output
quality.

For example, CD-DA tracks consisting of monaural speech can be encoded with:

``` shell
opusenc --speech --bitrate 24 --downmix-mono trackXY.wav trackXY.opus
```

When applied to Sierra's *Jones in the Fast Lane* audio track, Opus compresses
it from 373 MB down to 6.4 MB (98.2% savings in disk space) with no discernible
loss in quality.

For CD-DA tracks consisting of sound effects and relatively simple music, Opus
does fine with a bitrate between 54 and 70, where as more complex musical
tracks might need a bitrate of up to 84. Experiment and find your sweet spot!

``` shell
opusenc --bitrate 70 trackXY.wav trackXY.opus
```

If your CD-DA tracks are encoded at 48 kHz (which is Opus's default internal
rate), then feel free to configure `dosbox-staging`'s mixer rate to match,
which ensures your CD-DA will not be resampled through your audio chain; as
your sound card, USB speakers, and HDMI interface all (likely) operate at a
native rate of 48 kHz.

``` ini
[mixer]
rate = 48000
```

### <a name="pp" href="#pp">§</a> Pixel-perfect scaling mode

Pixel-perfect output scales the image by the largest integer multiplier that
fits within your monitor's native resolution. For example, given a 1920x1080
monitor and a 320x200 game requiring aspect-correction, each of its pixels
would be scaled by 4x5 to produce a 1280x1000 image. This preserves the
original artwork without *any* edge blurring.

To enable pixel-perfect output, apply the following settings to the indicated
`[section]`s of your dosbox-staging configuration file, as follows:

``` ini
[sdl]
fullscreen = true
output     = texturepp

[render]
scaler   = none
glshader = none
```

Pixel-perfect looks like this on a 1080p screen:

[![HoMM2](/homm2-pp-2x2-min.png)][homm2pp]

Heroes of Might and Magic 2 (1996)  
640x480 with a [pixel aspect ration (PAR)][par] of 1:1, upscaled to 2x2

[![Wolf3D](/wolf3d-pp-4x5-min.png)][wolf3dpp]

Wolfenstein 3D (1992)  
320x200 with a PAR of 1:1.2 (non-square pixels), upscaled to 4x5 with a PAR of 1:1.25

[wolf3dpp]: /wolf3d-pp-4x5.png

### <a name="resizable" href="#resizable">§</a> Resizable window

Being able to click and drag to resize an application's window is not a
revolutionary feature by any measure, however it's a welcome addition for
`dosbox-staging`!

{{ youtube(id="9J2U-qFxE1E", class="youtube") }}

This feature is a work-in-progress: it's available on Linux by default, and can
be enabled for testing on Windows and macOS by setting the following (but note
that it does not yet work correctly on these systems):

``` ini
[sdl]
windowresolution = resizable
```

On all systems, the resizable window is only available for `output = opengl`
and `glshader = sharp`. Support will be expanded to more outputs and shaders in
the future versions.

### <a name="autotype" href="#autotype">§</a> AUTOTYPE command

`AUTOTYPE` is a command-line tool provided by `dosbox-staging` that performs
scripted keyboard entry into the running DOS program or game.

It can be used to reliably skip intros, provide input to answer initial startup
or configuration questions, or conduct a simple demo.

Simply run the command to learn more:

``` shell
Z:> autotype
```

A list of games that benefit from AUTOTYPE on startup are listed on this [wiki page][autotype].

[autotype]: https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging/wiki/AUTOTYPE-Candidates

### <a name="rdef" href="#rdef">§</a> Changed rendering defaults

The following default configuration settings were changed to improve the
out-of-the box experience for the majority of games running on modern hardware.

The default video settings now use SDL's OpenGL rendering backend, apply a 4:3
aspect ratio correction, and scale the image using the `sharp` OpenGL shader to
provide relatively sharp pixels when in fullscreen-mode.

[![Battle Chess](/bc.png)](/bc.png)

### <a name="mouse" href="#mouse">§</a> Expand mouse control methods

The prior "autolocking" mouse option used by DOSBox has been renamed in
dosbox-staging to `capture_mouse`, which is configured using two values
defining how the mouse behaves.

The first value defines how the mouse is controlled:

- `onclick` - The mouse will be captured with a click inside the window.
- `onstart` - The mouse is captured immediately on start (similar to real DOS).
- `seamless` - The mouse will move seamlessly in and out of the window and
  cannot be captured.
- `nomouse` - The mouse is disabled and hidden without any input sent to the
  game.

The second value defines how middle-clicks are handled:

- `middlegame` - Middle-clicks are sent to the game (not used to uncapture the
  mouse).
- `middlerelease`- Middle-click will uncapture the mouse when windowed (not
  sent to the game).

For example:

``` ini
[sdl]
capture_mouse = onclick middlerelease
```

Will capture the mouse on the first click inside dosbox-staging's window, and a
middle-click will release the mouse. Note that the prior method to release the
mouse still works (pressing Ctrl-F10).

Note that dosbox-staging defaults to `seamless` mouse capture both to simplify
multi-tasking in windowed-mode and provide a frustration-free experience for
new users. However, some games and Windows 3.1 make their own adjustments to
the mouse position and will cause an offset-effect. In these cases, we
recommend switching to fullscreen (Alt-Enter) or configuring the mouse to capture
`onclick` or `onstart`.

*These options do not affect the mouse behavior in fullscreen (Alt-Enter), as the mouse is always captured.*

### <a name="nuked" href="#nuked">§</a> Nuked OPL v1.8

The cycle-accurate Nuked [OPL3][opl] emulator by has is now used by default,
and improves AdLib and SoundBlaster FM music emulation accuracy.

This improved accuracy comes at a slightly higher CPU use-cost, which is insignificant for the vast majority of users on typical desktop or laptop hardware.

However those using `dosbox-staging` on old or CPU-limited hardware (capable of
30,000 dosbox "cycles" or less, such as the Raspberry Pi 3) will be served best
using the `fast` OPL emulator (see the `oplemu` documentation provided in the
configuration file).

[opl]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaha_YMF262

### <a name="config" href="#config">§</a> Reload key bindings in runtime

Built-in `CONFIG` shell command is old, but a little-known feature allowing
user to reconfigure dosbox-staging at runtime.  This is a nifty way to change
configuration using e.g. batch scripts based on user input.

#### Reloading key bindings

User can now change key bindings at runtime by loading them from a file:

``` shell
Z:\> config -set "sdl mapperfile=<path-to-file>"
```

#### Other new options (SVN)

DOSBox added a number of features to the `config` command. To list them all,
run:

``` shell
Z:\> config /?
```

### <a name="xdg" href="#xdg">§</a> Configuration file locations

#### Linux

dosbox-staging's configuration-file location has been updated to comply wit the
[XDG Base Directory Specification][xdg]. This means dosbox-staging will no
longer going create configuration directories directly in your home directory.

Configuration files are now located in:

``` text
~/.config/dosbox/
```

Users can customize the parent (`.config/`) location by setting the
`XDG_CONFIG_HOME` environment variable, according to the [XDG
Specification][xdg].

[xdg]: https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html

#### macOS

The path was slightly changed to avoid spaces in the default configuration
filename and to group all configuration files in a single directory:

``` text
~/Library/Preferences/DOSBox/
```

#### Windows

*No changes; the configuration files are created in:*

``` text
C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\DOSBox\
```

### <a name="dynarec" href="#dynarec">§</a> 64-bit Dynamic Recompilation (SVN)

DOSBox has had [dynamic recompilation][dynarec] support for a long time, but it
was limited to 32-bit builds.  Support for 64-bit dynarec improves CPU
emulation speed and quality across the board - this is especially visible to
Linux and macOS users<sup>＊</sup>.

{{ youtube(id="9N-wXIamSh4", class="youtube") }}

Stargunner (1996) freeware; running on Linux x86\_64 via Boxtron

*Before 64-bit dynarec, this game had serious emulation problems resulting in
fluctuating emulation speed (sometimes too fast, sometimes too slow -
regardless of cycles settings). This game was designed to run with constant
70FPS and now it runs with constant 70FPS.*

[dynarec]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_recompilation

<sup>
＊ - dosbox-staging 0.75.0 stable Windows build is still 32-bit; Linux and
macOS builds are 64-bits.
</sup>

### <a name="cga" href="#cga">§</a> CGA improvements

[![CGA modes comparison](/cga-showcase-1-min.png)][cga4]

[cga4]:/cga-showcase-1.png

Maniac Mansion (1987), with forced CGA mode

- *top-left: CGA, default palette*
- *top-right: CGA/mono, green tint selected*
- *bottom-left: CGA Composite, early model, default hue*
- *bottom-right: CGA Composite, late model, default hue*

#### CGA monochrome mode

Many [CGA][cga] games from the 80's were designed to support monochromatic
cathode-ray tube (CRT) monitors that used either an amber, green, or
grayscale-shaded phosphor coating. As such, some games look much better when
rendered using a similar monochrome palette. This mode is designed to emulate
such displays.

Use `machine = cga_mono`

*User can switch between green, amber, white, and paper-white palettes at
runtime using&nbsp;F11.*

[cga]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_Graphics_Adapter

#### CGA Composite mode (SVN)

Technical artifacts caused by the composite video format were cleverly used by
game developers to to generate extra colors (versus non-composite CGA) by
manipulating pixel positions on screen.  For example, adjacent pixels would be
partly "averaged" (through horizontal overlap), producing interposed solid
colors or generating rudimentary transparency effects.

[Composite][comp] mode was added to DOSBox's CGA emulator in 2012, but was
never back-ported to any of its stable releases. Most users know this mode as
its commonly included in other DOSBox forks.

User can switch between Color and Composite mode, between CGA early and late
models, and adjust hue (all at runtime).

*The default keyboard binds for manipulating CGA modes conflict with
other essential binds. It's advisable to change them, if you plan to play
with this. The default key for turning on composite is F12.*

[comp]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_artifact_colors

### <a name="glsl" href="#glsl">§</a> GLSL shader support (SVN)

Shaders written in [OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL)][glsl] offload the task of
processing the emulated game's output to your GPU hardware.

This allows the image to be altered in many ways, such as emulating the analog
artifacts (scanlines, shadow masks, and phosphor glow) present in circa-1980's
and 90s CRT monitor, on modern 1080p and greater LCD panels.

The user can specific which shader to use by setting the `glshader` value in
the configuration file's `render` selection:

``` ini
[render]
glshader = sharp
```

It's also possible to provide your own shader implementations by placing `.glsl`
file in the configuration directory and selecting it in the configuration file, e.g.:

Place `test.glsl` file in the configuration directory:

``` ini
(Linux)   ~/.config/dosbox/glshaders/
(macOS)   ~/Library/Preferences/DOSBox/glshaders/
(Windows) C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\DOSBox\glshaders\
```

And select it in the configuration file:

``` ini
glshader = test.glsl
```

[![X-Wing Collector's Edition](/xwingce-lottes.png)][lottes]

STAR WARS™ - X-Wing: Collector's CD-ROM Edition (1994)

*Using CRT-Lottes shader on 1080p screen; click to see the fine details.
This shader is not bundled with dosbox-staging (yet), you can download it
from [here][tyrells].*

[glsl]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL_Shading_Language
[lottes]: /xwingce-lottes.png
[tyrells]: https://github.com/tyrells/dosbox-svn-shaders

***Note:*** when using a `glshader`, we recommend setting the `scaler` type to
`none` to ensure image post-processing is performed exclusively by the shader
(and not a mix of the two).

### <a name="date" href="#date">§</a> DATE and TIME commands (SVN)

DOS's traditional `DATE` and `TIME` commands were added to DOSBox. This allows
the user to change the perceived date for software running inside the emulator:

``` shell
Z:\> text
Current date: Fri 05/01/2020
Type ´date MM-DD-YYYY´ to change.

Z:\> time
Current time: 11:08:23,34
```

This feature is useful for running old batch scripts and bypassing date checks
in some old software.

### <a name="overlay" href="#overlay">§</a> Mount overlay support (SVN)

This feature allows user to transparently redirect new and changed files
to a different location. The files in the overlay and normal drive are merged
on startup and kept up to date when the game writes something.

This feature is useful for redirecting save files or configuration files
to a different location (e.g. for backup or cloud saves).

Example usage:

``` text
Z:\> mount C real
Drive C is mounted as local directory real/

Z:\> mount C backup -t overlay
Overlay backup/ on drive C mounted.

Z:\> C:
C:\> echo foo > test.txt

C:\> type TEST.TXT
foo
```

File `TEST.TXT` is written to directory `backup`, and not to `real`.

## <a name="overview" href="#overview">§</a> Overview of Changes

### <a name="removed" href="#removed">§</a> Removed Features

- dosbox-staging does not run on Operating System/2 (OS/2) or derivatives.
- dosbox-staging does not run on Windows older than XP.
- Removed support for old DirectDraw (`ddraw`) output.  
  Use `output = texture`, `texture_renderer = directx11` instead.
- Removed support for old `overlay` output. Use any other output.
- Removed support for relative window size (`windowresolution = X%`).
- Removed support for 64-bit Zip Motion Blocks Video (ZMBV) codec (old 32-bit
  codec still works).
- Removed support for CD-DA playback from physical disks. It is
  still possible to install games distributed on CDs by mounting them as
  directories. See [#260][260].
- Removed CD-DA playback support for tracks using the Audio Interchange File
  Format [AIFF][aiff] audio codec.

[aiff]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_Interchange_File_Format

### <a name="developer-features" href="#developer-features">§</a> Development Changes

- Migrated the DOSBox source from Apache's Subversion (SVN) software versioning
  and revision control system to the Git distributed version-control system
  using GitHub, while preserving all publicly available project history.
  - Active SVN branch paths were imported as Git branches (named`svn/<name>`).
  - SVN tag paths were imported as Git lightweight tags (named
    `svn/<tag-name>`).
- Ongoing upstream SVN development work is being imported in a timely manner to
  the Git branch named `svn/trunk`.
- Began the migration to and allowance for C++11 language constructs.
- Implemented a Continuous Integration (CI) system that builds on every code
  push to provide immediate feedback to developers regarding build-success and
  warning-counts on:
  - Windows x86_64 using GCC 32 and 64-bit, Clang 32 and 64-bit, and
    VisualStudio 64-bit compilers
  - macOS x86_64 using GCC and Clang compilers
  - Linux x86_64, ARMv6, ARMv7, IBM LinuxONE, and IBM POWER8 platforms using
    various versions of GCC and Clang
- Added static analysis checks performed by LLVM's Clang, Synopsys's Coverity,
  and VIVA64's Program Verification Systems (PVS) Studio.
- Added dynamic analysis checks performed by Clang's undefined-behavior (UB)
  sanitizer and GCC's UB and Address sanitizers.
- The CI system includes gated checks that allow maintainers to focus on code
  functionality and correctness. These automated checks guarantee that new
  code:
  - builds clean on all supported platforms and compilers,
  - adds no new compiler warnings, and
  - adds no new static or dynamic analysis issues.
- Notable progress has been made in reducing the number of warnings and
  analysis issues flagged by these tools.
- *Windows*: the build-system was adjusted to allow easy compilation, without
  manual download or patching of dependencies. We use `vcpkg` to manage
  dependencies. The solution file was fixed to work with Visual Studio 2019.
- *Linux and macOS*: implemented a number of small build-system improvements.
- Automated the compilation of release-style builds against the latest master
  and feature branches. These not only save time for testers wanting to verify
  new features and bugfixes, but also ensures they're running builds compiled
  using would-be release settings.
- *macOS*: release binaries are compiled with optimizations supporting Intel
  Nehalem-based instructions (and newer), as this matches the minimum processor
  requirements set by macOS Catalina.
- Release packages are scanned using up-to-date Antivirus software: ClamAV for
  Linux and macOS, and Windows Defender for Windows.
- The project has published a Code of Conduct along with clear Contributor
  Guidelines.

### <a name="known-issues" href="#known-issues">§</a> Known issues

- Inconsistent minimum window size with `windowresolution = resizable` when
  leaving fullscreen.
- Windows, macOS: Window content is not refreshed when resizing.
- Windows, macOS: Emulation stops when moving or resizing window.
