## 1. dosbox-staging 0.75.1 Bugfix Release Notes

**Installation instructions:**

- [Linux](/downloads/linux/) (or [Steam on Linux](/downloads/linux#steam))
- [Windows](/downloads/windows/)
- [macOS](/downloads/macos/)

This is a small bugfix release from 0.75.x stable branch - it includes few
changes and bugfixes backported from upcoming 0.76.x version.

Check out our growing [Wiki](https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging/wiki).

Brave souls with an inkling for an adventure can test our work-in-progress
[0.76.x&nbsp;alpha builds](/downloads/devel/) :). Please report any issues in
our [bugtracker](https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging/issues).

## 2. New Features in Detail

### 2.1. Add support for binding more controller axes

Users can now comfortably use both sticks, as commonly found on modern
controllers (like DualShock or any Xbox controller). Previously, only
one stick could be mapped.

This change does not make old games "magically" recognize all features of
modern controllers. You need to map additional controller events to emulated
keyboard, mouse, or joystick events using DOSBox keymapper (Ctrl+F1).

*This was one of highly-requested community patches, that was never accepted
in upstream SVN.  In dosbox-staging we included version, that provides support
for up to 10 axes per controller.*

### 2.2. Provide Windows x64 builds

Windows 64-bit builds are now provided alongside 32-bit builds.
Additional performance optimization ([WPO](wpo)) was turned on for for both.

Both builds require SSE 4.2 instruction set now.

*Steam Hardware survey indicates that 97.45% users have CPUs supporting
SSE 4.2, so your CPU is very likely good enough :). Linux and macOS builds
have equivalent [LTO](lto) and SSE 4.2 enabled since 0.75.0 release.*

### 2.3. Log base address of emulated memory

Some users like to use external tools to investigate and modify memory
used by DOS games (e.g. for Cheat Engine).  Usually it means users need to
debug DOSBox binary they want to use and find out what's base memory offset
of emulated memory (which is easy but tedious).

Make life easier for such users by simply logging the appropriate address.
Users will see these new lines in log, e.g.:

    MEMORY: Base address: 0x5c758e0
    MEMORY: Using 4096 DOS memory pages (16 MiB)
