**Installation instructions:**

- [Linux](/downloads/linux/) (or [Steam on Linux](/downloads/linux#steam))
- [Windows](/downloads/windows/)
- [macOS](/downloads/macos/)

This is a small bugfix release from 0.75.x stable branch - it includes a few
changes and bugfixes backported from upcoming 0.76.x version.

Check out our growing [Wiki](https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging/wiki).

Brave souls interested in the latest features can test our work-in-progress
[0.76.x&nbsp;alpha builds](/downloads/devel/) :). Please report any issues in
our [bugtracker](https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging/issues).

## 2. New Features in Detail

### 2.1. Add support for binding more controller axes

Users can now comfortably use both sticks, as commonly found on modern
controllers (like DualShock or any Xbox controller). Previously, only
one stick could be mapped.

This change does not make old games "magically" recognize all features of
modern controllers. You need to map additional controller events to emulated
keyboard, mouse, or joystick events using DOSBox's keymapper (Ctrl+F1).

*This was a highly-requested community patches that wasn't accepted by the
upstream DOSBox project.  We've included the 10-axes per controller version
of the patch in dosbox-staging.*

### 2.2. Provide Windows x64 builds

Windows 64-bit builds are now provided alongside 32-bit builds.
Additional performance optimizations ([WPO](wpo)) are enabled for both
builds. Linux and macOS builds have been similarly optimized using [LTO](lto)
since the 0.75.0 release.

Both Windows builds now require SSE 4.2 instruction set, which is now on par
with the Linux and macOS builds that have required SSE 4.2 support since
the 0.75.0 release.

*Steam Hardware survey indicates that 97.45% users have CPUs supporting
SSE 4.2, so your CPU is very likely good enough :)*

### 2.3. Log base address of emulated memory

For those using external tools that operate on DOS's emulated memory
region, such as various cheat engine do, this release makes life easier
by logging the memory's base address to the console:

    MEMORY: Base address: 0x5c758e0
    MEMORY: Using 4096 DOS memory pages (16 MiB)

Users previously had to debug the dosbox binary to discover the base
address; an easy but tedious process.
