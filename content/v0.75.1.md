## <a name="new-features" href="#new-features">§</a> New Features in Detail

### <a name="axes" href="#axes">§</a> Add support for binding more controller axes 

TODO describe


### <a name="winx64" href="#winx64">§</a> Provide Windows x64 builds

Windows 64-bit builds are now provided alongside 32-bit builds.
Additional performance optimization ([WPO](wpo)) was turned on for for both.

Both builds require SSE 4.2 instruction set now.

*Steam Hardware survey indicates that 97.45% users have CPUs supporting
SSE 4.2, so your CPU is very likely good enough :). Linux and macOS builds
have equivalent [LTO](lto) and SSE 4.2 enabled since 0.75.0 release.*

### <a name="base" href="#base">§</a> Log base address of emulated memory

Some users like to use external tools to investigate and modify memory
used by DOS games (e.g. for Cheat Engine).  Usually it means users need to
debug DOSBox binary they want to use and find out what's base memory offset
of emulated memory (which is easy but tedious).

Make life easier for such users by simply logging the appropriate address.
Users will see these new lines in log, e.g.:

    MEMORY: Base address: 0x5c758e0
    MEMORY: Using 4096 DOS memory pages (16 MiB)
