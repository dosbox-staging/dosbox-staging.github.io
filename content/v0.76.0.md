## 2. New Features in Detail

### Improve --editconf option

TODO describe for non-technical users
```
commit 2ccae54e8444bc69bef200a1de38bf2ac9b81d27
Author: Patryk Obara <dreamer.tan@gmail.com>
Date:   Mon Apr 27 21:43:40 2020 +0200

    Improve --editconf option
    
    No user expects, that editor name needs to be manually supplied, and
    documentation is not clear about this either.
    
    Add GNU-style double-dash long parameter. Unfortunately, --opt=value
    style does not work with DOSBox non-standard parameter handling
    implementation.
    
    When user won't supply value for the parameter, following editors will
    be tried in order:
    
    - Program supplied via EDITOR environment variable
    - nano
    - vim
    - vi
    - notepad++.exe
    - notepad.exe
```


### Add LS command

TODO describe for non-technical users

```
commit a767145a2862e1552bc842a623df085470efb7b7
Author: Patryk Obara <dreamer.tan@gmail.com>
Date:   Fri May 22 19:31:28 2020 +0200

    Rudimentary ls implementation
    
    This is not supposed to be fully-featured ls command, as GNU ls, only a
    quick replacement for ls to make output more readable.
    
    Simply list all files, the same way DIR command does, except for
    formatting and skipping most switches. Store listing in a temporary
    vector (the same way DIR does), in case we'll want to implement sorting
    flags in the future.
    
    Use uppercase for directories and lowercase for files (same way Norton
    Commander differentiates between files and directories). Use blue colour
    for directories (the same way GNU ls does by default).
```


### Add an option for DC-correction for emulated PC speaker

TODO describe for non-technical users, link PRs for technical details

```
neutralize_dc_offset = false
```


### Dynamic recompilation for PowerPC and POWER8 (ppc64le)

TODO describe for non-technical users
TODO notify author of ppc64le patch!


### Audio envelope

TODO do we want this in notes for end-users?
f29cf5509bf829ae515120805c87a94473ae1261


### Add an option for skipping the splash screen

TODO describe for non-technical users

```
commit 50d3e8228dd73ac9fe1cb19e1aa8ef522bf6b786
Author: kcgen <1557255+kcgen@users.noreply.github.com>
Date:   Wed Jul 1 20:29:12 2020 -0700

    Add a configurable "Startup Verbosity" setting

    [dosbox]
    startup_verbosity = high # medium, low, quiet, auto

    Also adds a GetStartupVerbosity() getter to the control class,
    so we can query this from various places.

    This commit is dormant though - no code uses it.
```


### Revise help messages for built-in commands

TODO describe for non-technical users

DIR 934485421ff4558c269606e4007a4e712adfc6ca
MOUNT ??
IMGMOUNT ??


### Revise help messages for built-in commands

TODO describe for non-technical users
GUS improvements
TODO Many commits and PRs


### Add pixel-perfect option when using OpenGL output

TODO describe for non-technical users
openglpp was supposed to be temporary, but we'll deprecate it in 0.77.0
TODO showcase pixel-perfect + resizable window

```
    Add openglpp option

    It's a temporary; should be supported as hidden, "deprecated"
    option; other forks provide it as an option, so we need to handle it
    (with a warning) but we shouldn't advertise it to the users.
```


### Add FluidSynth support

TODO describe for non-technical users
Important commits:
- fb5ad16a598839c930ef1d1cc1c3a5eb91f7939d


### Improve Softmodem support

TODO describe for non-technical users

several changes, e.g. 
Permit full-length hostnames in softmodem's command sequence
Let telnet-mode for softmodems be set via the conf-file
(and more)


### Add an option for setting monochrome palette colour

Mention, that it was backported to 0.75.2 already?


### Properly set modify time on written files

```
    Properly set modify time on written files

    Implements the missing part of DOS function 57h which sets modify time
    on a file. Previously, it was a stub.
    "copy" command now copies over file modify time as well.

    This should fix some install programs which check file modify dates.

    Code taken from this patch ripped from ykhwong's fork by gulikoza:
    https://www.vogons.org/viewtopic.php?t=22600
```

### Raw mouse input

Mention, that it was backported to 0.75.2 already?

7bb013a021b0f376df169478bf81c1702bbafb6a


### Raw mouse input

Add dosbox --help -h command option.

Perhaps merge with mount/imgmount help?


### Case-insensitive paths handling

For mount, imgmount commands.

```
commit 1f03e0fec9c0e0a4b614c1990f5bec1612c4ebda
Author: Patryk Obara <dreamer.tan@gmail.com>
Date:   Sat Oct 17 19:59:04 2020 +0200

    Treat imgmount input path as case-insensitive
    
    Add more logs, so it should be easier for users to figure out what is
    happening when the imgmount command can't find the file.
    
    This change is required to make the .conf files cross-platform. It's
    usual practice for DOS packagers and distributors to write imgmount
    commands expecting case-insensitive filesystem and Windows path
    separators.
    
    DOSBox already does various path conversions to accomodate e.g. switching
    directory separators or even checks if path can't be loaded as
    case-insensitive when relative to virtual DOS drive.
```


### Revise default keyboard shortcuts

TODO describe for non-technical users

- **Alt-Enter** - Switch between fullscreen and window mode.
- **Alt-Pause** - Pause/Unpause emulator.
- **Ctrl-F1** - Start the keymapper.
- **Ctrl-F4** - Change between mounted floppy/CD images.
- **Ctrl-F5** - Save a screenshot.
- **Ctrl-F6** - Start/Stop recording sound output to a wave file.
- **Ctrl-F7** - Start/Stop recording video output to a zmbv file.
- **Ctrl-F9** - Shutdown emulator.
- **Ctrl-F10** - Capture/Release the mouse.
- **Ctrl-F11** - Slow down emulation.
- **Ctrl-F12** - Speed up emulation.
- **Ctrl-Alt-Home** - Restart emulator.
- hold **Alt-F12** - Fast forward.

Keymapper received tiny usabity improvements as well: it displays
keyboard shortcut (binding) for selected action.
