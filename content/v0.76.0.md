## 1. Summary

## 2. New Features in Detail

### Improve --editconf option

TODO describe for non-technical users
```
commit 2ccae54e8444bc69bef200a1de38bf2ac9b81d27
Author: Patryk Obara <dreamer.tan@gmail.com>
Date:   Mon Apr 27 21:43:40 2020 +0200

    Improve --editconf option
    
    No user expects, that editor name needs to be manually supplied, and
    documentation is not clear about this either.
    
    Add GNU-style double-dash long parameter. Unfortunately, --opt=value
    style does not work with DOSBox non-standard parameter handling
    implementation.
    
    When user won't supply value for the parameter, following editors will
    be tried in order:
    
    - Program supplied via EDITOR environment variable
    - nano
    - vim
    - vi
    - notepad++.exe
    - notepad.exe
```

### Add LS command

TODO describe for non-technical users

```
commit a767145a2862e1552bc842a623df085470efb7b7
Author: Patryk Obara <dreamer.tan@gmail.com>
Date:   Fri May 22 19:31:28 2020 +0200

    Rudimentary ls implementation
    
    This is not supposed to be fully-featured ls command, as GNU ls, only a
    quick replacement for ls to make output more readable.
    
    Simply list all files, the same way DIR command does, except for
    formatting and skipping most switches. Store listing in a temporary
    vector (the same way DIR does), in case we'll want to implement sorting
    flags in the future.
    
    Use uppercase for directories and lowercase for files (same way Norton
    Commander differentiates between files and directories). Use blue colour
    for directories (the same way GNU ls does by default).
```

### Revise default keyboard shortcuts

TODO describe for non-technical users

- **Alt-Enter** - Switch between fullscreen and window mode.
- **Alt-Pause** - Pause/Unpause emulator.
- **Ctrl-F1** - Start the keymapper.
- **Ctrl-F4** - Change between mounted floppy/CD images.
- **Ctrl-F5** - Save a screenshot.
- **Ctrl-F6** - Start/Stop recording sound output to a wave file.
- **Ctrl-F7** - Start/Stop recording video output to a zmbv file.
- **Ctrl-F9** - Shutdown emulator.
- **Ctrl-F10** - Capture/Release the mouse.
- **Ctrl-F11** - Slow down emulation.
- **Ctrl-F12** - Speed up emulation.
- **Ctrl-Alt-Home** - Restart emulator.
- hold **Alt-F12** - Fast forward.

Keymapper received tiny usabity improvements as well: it displays
keyboard shortcut (binding) for selected action.
