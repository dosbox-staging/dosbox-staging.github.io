Previously networking in WfW was only possible when booting a real MS-DOS installation from a bootable HDD image (Wengier, nanshiki)

* [Added](https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging/pull/1451) IDE controller support for CDROM image-mounts, which is useful for CDROM-based games that also happen to need a real DOS environment such as Revell's car games, like European Racers (Wengier)
