##  3. New Features in Detail <a name="NewFeatures" href="#NewFeatures">§</a>


### 3.1. AdLib Gold Surround Module emulation <a name="AdLibGold" href="#AdLibGold">§</a>

The ultra-rare AdLib Gold surround sound daughterboard is now fully emulated, which makes it possible to finally enjoy the [Dune soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDE06DE88BB135F33) in its full glory! That's the only game in existence that makes use of the surround module.

The following config is recommended for [Dune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(video_game)). The setup utility should auto-detect AdLib Gold and the surround module correctly with these settings.

```ini
[sblaster]
sbtype = sb16
oplmode = opl3gold
```

### 3.2. Sound card output filter emulation <a name="SoundOutputFilters" href="#SoundOutputFilters">§</a>

Most DOS-era sound cards feature an output low-pass filter (and sometimes a high-pass filter too) that play an important role in giving their sound its character. DOSBox Staging can now accurately emulate these analog output stage filters for all supported sound devices.

#### Sound Blaster <a name="SoundOutputFilters-SoundBlaster" href="#SoundOutputFilters-SoundBlaster">§</a>


For backward compatibility reasons, the `sb_filter` config parameter defaults to the newly introduced `modern` filter, which uses the simple linear interpolation method of previous DOSBox versions. To turn on accurate analog output filter emulation, set the `sb_filter` to `auto`. This will set the correct filters for each Sound Blaster model depending on the `sb_type` value. You can also set a model-specific filter manually if you wish, e.g. this is how to use a Sound Blaster 16 but with Sound Blaster Pro filters:

```ini
[sblaster]
sbtype = sb16
sb_filter = sbpro1
```

Some Sound Blaster models can toggle the filter on and off in software; you can force the filter to be always on by setting `sb_filter_always_on` to `true`.

OPL and CMS filters are also accurately emulated; please refer to the descriptions of the `opl_filter` and `cms_filter` config parameters for further details.


#### Small-speaker systems <a name="SoundOutputFilters-SmallSpeaker" href="#SoundOutputFilters-SmallSpeaker">§</a>


Filters are enabled by default for all small-speaker audio systems (PC Speaker, PS/1 Audio, Tandy, and the various LPT DAC options). Depending on the particular device, these filters either emulate the analog output filters of the original device, or the sound coming out of a small band-limited speaker in an acoustic environment. Either way, the result is a more period-accurate and pleasant listening experience, especially on headphones.

Small-speaker filters are controlled by the following config parameters:

* `lpt_dac_filter`
* `pcspeaker_filter`
* `ps1audio_dac_filter`
* `ps1audio_filter`
* `tandy_dac_filter`
* `tandy_filter`


#### Custom filters <a name="SoundOutputFilters-Custom" href="#SoundOutputFilters-Custom">§</a>


Advanced users can specify custom filter settings for any of the supported sound devices. You can specify either a high-pass filter, a low-pass filter, or both at the same time using the following format

	TYPE ORDER FREQ [TYPE ORDER FREQ]

where **TYPE** can be `hpf` (high-pass) or `lpf` (low-pass), **ORDER** is the order of the filter from 1 to 16 (1st order results in a 6dB per octave slope, 2nd order in a 12dB per octave slope, etc.), and **FREQ** is the filter's cutoff frequency in Hz.

For example, to use a 2nd order (12dB/oct) low-pass filter at 8 kHz for the Sound Blaster:

```ini
sb_filter = lpf 2 8000
```

To use a 3rd order (18dB/oct) high-pass filter at 120 Hz, and a 1st order (6dB/oct) low-pass filter at 6.5 kHz for the PC Speaker:

```ini
pcspeaker_filter = hpf 3 120 lfp 1 6500
```

In addition to the sound devices mentioned above, you use custom filters even with devices that don't filter the output in the original hardware (e.g. GUS, MT-32), and the FluidSynth virtual MIDI device via the following config parameters:

* `fsynth_filter`
* `gus_filter`
* `innovation_filter`
* `mt32_filter`


### 3.3. Crossfeed <a name="Crossfeed" href="#Crossfeed">§</a>

Listening to audio material on headphones where certain sounds are only present in either the left or the right channel can be a rather distracting and unpleasant experience. This is most noticeable on certain Dual OPL game soundtracks and tracker music (e.g. MOD, XM, S3M, IT, etc.)

The new crossfeed feature remedies that; by enabling `crossfeed` in the `[mixer]` section, a certain percentage of the left channel is mixed into the right, and vice versa. The default crossfeed strength is 40% which is a good general setting, but you can provide a custom percentage value as well (e.g. `crossfeed = 55`).

The amount of crossfeed can be fine-tuned per individual channels via mixer commands; please type `MIXER /?` in the DOSBox prompt for further details.


### 3.4. Reverb & Chorus <a name="ReverbChorus" href="#ReverbChorus">§</a>

#### Reverb <a name="ReverbChorus-Reverb" href="#ReverbChorus-Reverb">§</a>

One of the most exciting new audio features is the ability to add reverb (the emulation of real acoustic spaces) and chorus effects to any mixer channel. This can add a lot of atmosphere to dry-sounding synth soundtracks (typically OPL music) and elevate them to a whole new level! Enabling reverb and chorus processing is especially useful for headphone-listening.

The quickest way to enable the **reverb effect** globally is to put `reverb = on` in the `[mixer]` config section. This will add reverb to all synth channels (e.g. PC Speaker, OPL, CMS), and a lesser amount to digital audio channels (e.g. Sound Blaster, GUS). While the default setting works well in most games, it's highly recommended to experiment with the five available reverb presets to find the optimal setting for each game:

* `tiny` simulates the sound of a small integrated speaker in a domestic room. This preset is specifically tailored for small-speaker audio systems (PC Speaker, Tandy, PS/1 Audio, and LPT DAC devices).

* `small` adds a subtle sense of space; it's best suited for games that use a single synth channel (typically OPL) for both the music and the sound effects.

* `medium` is the default preset; it's a middle-of-the-road setting that works well with a wide variety of games.

* `large` is a large hall style reverb that is recommended for games that use separate audio channels for music and digital audio (e.g. OPL audio and Sound Blaster digital sound.)

* `huge` is a stronger variant of the large hall preset which is ideal for slower paced, atmospheric music.


#### Chorus <a name="ReverbChorus-Chorus" href="#ReverbChorus-Chorus">§</a>

Another way to add a sense of space to the sound is by enabling the **chorus effect**. This adds stereo movement and increases the perceived stereo width, which is especially noticeable on purely mono signals on headphones (e.g. PC Speaker or OPL2 music). To enable it, just put `chorus = on` into the `[mixer]` config section, or select one of three predefined chorus strength presets, `light`, `normal` or `strong`.

Similarly to crossfeed, per-channel reverb and chorus settings can be tweaked by mixer commands; please type `MIXER /?` in the DOSBox prompt for details.


#### Audio examples <a name="ReverbChorus-Examples" href="#ReverbChorus-Examples">§</a>

Naturally, you can combine chorus and reverb, and it's not only possible to do so, but highly recommended for achieving the best results! The below recordings showcase how crossfeed, reverb, chorus, and output stage filters can work in tandem to give old DOS game soundtracks a new life.

The exact settings used for these recordings are documented [on the Wiki](TODO), along with suggested audio configs for many other games. Make sure to check them out and experiment with the settings yourself! :sunglasses: :speaker: :headphones:

### 3.5. Master compressor <a name="MasterCompressor" href="#MasterCompressor">§</a> 

An auto-leveling dynamic range compressor has been introduced to the master channel to ensure that the audio output never gets distorted, no matter how high the volume levels are. This is on by default, and is virtually transparent when the output is not driven into clipping. However, purists can disable it by setting `compressor` to `off`, and then ensure correct non-clipping output levels manually.


### 3.6. General mixer improvements <a name="MixerImprovements" href="#MixerImprovements">§</a>

- The mixer now uses a full floating-point processing path internally, which means you can no longer overload individual mixer channels into clipping by using high per-channel volume settings. As long as the summed master output is not clipping, it's guaranteed that nothing else will.

- A fixed high-pass filter at 20 Hz has been introduced right before the final output that gets rid of any DC-offset and subsonic rumble globally.

- The `MIXER` command has received an overhaul too. First of all, the status output looks better, and the following improvements have been made:

  - Now you can set reverb, chorus, and crossfeed levels per mixer channel; type `MIXER /?` in the DOSBox prompt for further details.
  - The `FM` channel has been renamed to `OPL`.
  - The `SPKR` channel has been renamed to `PCSPEAKER`.
  - The sample rate column has been removed (it served no useful purpose, and the displayed values were often technically correct but misleading).


### 3.7. "One OPL mode to rule them all" &#128141; <a name="NukedOPL" href="#NukedOPL">§</a>

NukedOPL has long been the default OPL mode in Staging. As it's basically a bit-perfect emulation of the [Yamaha YMF262 OPL3 chip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaha_OPL#OPL3), and it runs fast enough even on low-end hardware such as the Raspberry Pi 4, all other less accurate OPL emulation modes have been removed.


### 3.8. FluidSynth configuration changes <a name="FluidSynthChanges" href="#FluidSynthChanges">§</a>

#### Reverb & Chorus <a name="FluidSynthChanges-ReverbChorus" href="#FluidSynthChanges-ReverbChorus">§</a>

Due to the introduction of the new mixer-level [reverb and chorus effects](#ReverbChorus), the FluidSynth `reverb` and `chorus` config parameters have been renamed to `fsynth_reverb` and `fsynth_chorus`, respectively.

To maintain backward compatibility with existing configurations, the FluidSynth reverb and chorus effects are enabled by default, so all your SoundFonts will sound just like in previous DOSBox versions. If you enable the mixer-level reverb (or chorus) as well (e.g. by putting `reverb = on` in the `[mixer]` section), you would get a *second* round of reverb (or chorus) processing on the FluidSynth output. This is by design as it allows users the greatest level of control over customising SoundFonts (e.g. some would sound best with the FluidSynth reverb only, some with both, etc.)

Note that in the SF2 format the reverb and chorus amounts are specified on a per-instrument basis, while the mixer-level effects are applied "globally" to all instruments in the summed FluidSynth output.
Therefore, what works best really depends on the particular SoundFont in question and on individual user preference (see [this discussion](TODO) for further technical details).

#### Volume scaling <a name="FluidSynthChanges-VolumeScaling" href="#FluidSynthChanges-VolumeScaling">§</a>

Previously, it was possible to specify a percentage after the SoundFont's name in the config to adjust its volume (e.g. `soundfont = way_too_loud.sf2 30`). This was introduced as a workaround for certain loud SoundFonts that had a tendency to clip the mixer channel internally.

With the floating-pointing mixer signal path it's no longer possible to drive any of the mixer channels into clipping, thereforce this workaround has been deprecated. Please use standard mixer commands to lower the volume of the `FSYNTH` channel if you wish to do so.


### 3.9. Shortcut to reload current shader <a name="ReloadShader" href="#ReloadShader">§</a>

As DOSBox Staging currently lacks a shader preset system, tweaking shader parameters can only be accomplished by making changes to the shader source files themselves. Previously, you had to restart DOSBox to see the effects of such changes, which made fine-tuning shaders quite cumbersome, to say the least.

Now you can just use the **Ctrl + F2** shortcut (**Cmd + F2** on macOS) to reload the current shader any time. Progress! :sunglasses:


### 3.10. Override default CGA palette <a name="CgaColorOverrides" href="#CgaColorOverrides">§</a>

Now it is possible to override the default, canonical interpretation of the 16-colour CGA/EGA RGBI palette. The feature overrides the CGA colours in any CGA/EGA-like mode, so it even works in CGA/EGA modes on an emulated VGA card, or on the Tandy.

A number of presets have been included (e.g. Amiga and Atari ST colours for Sierra games, and various CGA/EGA monitor emulations), and you can specify custom palettes as well. Make sure to check out the description of the `cga_colors` config parameter for the list of available presets (you can read more about them
[here](https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging/pull/1794)).


#### Defender of the Crown

_`tandy-warm` emulates the colours as they appear on an actual Tandy monitor, which results in more subdued and pleasant colours. This is especially apparent on the greens._

### Code pages and keyboard layouts <a name="CodePages" href="#CodePages">§</a>

The 20 years old FreeDOS code pages (screen fonts) and keyboard layouts were updated to the latest versions, countless of new definitions are now available. For a full list see the documentation:

- [here](https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging/blob/1ae448a58ef03bf9d5b69a3a9017df07ac6029f6/contrib/resources/freedos-cpi/DOC/CODEPAGE.TXT) for the list of available code pages
- [here](https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging/blob/1ae448a58ef03bf9d5b69a3a9017df07ac6029f6/contrib/resources/freedos-keyboard/DOC/LAYOUTS.TXT) for the list of available keyboard layouts

Some notable examples:

- `KEYB bg 3021` - sets a Bulgarian keyboard layout and code page, with Cyrillic characters encoded according to the MIK standard
- `KEYB cz489 867` - a so-called programmer keyboard layout (national characters available with right ALT + number) for Czech and Slovak languages, with Kamenický character encoding - which was more popular than code page 852
- `KEYB de 858` - German keyboard, code page with EUR currency symbol
- `KEYB hu 3845` - Hungarian keyboard, CWI-2 character encoding
- `KEYB pl 668` - code page specially designed for Polish language; places national characters on the same positions as standard code page 852 (so it is compatible with current software and text documents), but preserves more table drawing symbols
- `KEYB pl 667` - Mazovia encoding for Polish language, used mainly by older business software

### Mouse wheel emulation <a name="MouseWheel" href="#MouseWheel">§</a>

The built-in mouse driver now provides a wheel support for application aware of CuteMouse extensions; examples include <em>Necromancer's DOS Navigator</em> and <em>Mpxplay</em>.

The original CuteMouse driver version 2.1 is also able to use the PS/2 mouse wheel, just start it with `CTMOUSE /o`.

### Serial mice emulation <a name="MouseSerial" href="#MouseSerial">§</a>

Numerous serial (COM port) mice are now emulated:

- original Microsoft mouse with 2 buttons
- Logitech mouse, with 3 buttons
- wheel mouse with 3 buttons
- Mouse Systems mouse (old mouse type, not compatible with the ones listed above), with 3 buttons

To enable serial mouse type `SERIAL 1 mouse` command (this will attach it to COM1 port), or edit the `[serial]` section of the configuration file. By default DOSBox Staging tries to determine what kind of mouse the game or application expects.

With serial mouse emulation, Windows 1.01 is finally usable!

### Windows 3.1 seamless mouse integration <a name="MouseVMWare" href="#MouseVMWare">§</a>

It is now possible to have a seamless mouse integration using one of the following 3rd party VMware-compatible Windows 3.1 mouse drivers:

- [driver](https://git.javispedro.com/cgit/vbados.git/about/) by <em>javispedro</em> - this one requires a corresponding DOS mouse driver to be started; this driver also provides seamless mouse integration for a real DOS if booted inside DOSBox Staging

- [driver](https://github.com/NattyNarwhal/vmwmouse) by <em>NattyNarwhal</em> - does not require any specific DOS driver and has experimental support for mouse wheel, but current version 0.1 has stability problems

For now only the mouse is supported (no VMware directory sharing, etc.), only using VMware protocol (no VirtualBox-only drivers). Windows 9x VMware mouse driver is not supported.

### High DPI on macOS <a name="HiDPI" href="#HiDPI">§</a>

The backstory: DOSBox Staging uses OpenGL output with the sharp bilinear scaling shader to keep the picture crisp no matter how big or small the image is, and minimize blurring on pixel transitions.

Due to the way MacOS handles DPI scaling, the image is actually drawn at a much lower resolution, usually just a quarter of the window size. Then it was stretched by the system, producing an unpleasantly mushy presentation. But we want our pixels to be so sharp they could cut one's eyes.

[picture - TBD]

Now DOSBox Staging is able to handle high DPI displays, be it Retina or not, so you and shaders alike can see all the (physical) pixels.

Please note that this is currently experimental: only macOS is currently supported, and we haven't thoroughly tested multi-display setups. Please report any weird behaviour! Support for Windows will come in the future, and for Linux it is still uncertain. Also note that due to the way rendering is currently implemented, you may observe lowered performance on higher resolution displays, especially when running off integrated graphics. This might be remedied in the future as well.

### ripa's PC speaker patch <a name="ImpulsePcSpeaker" href="#ImpulsePcSpeaker">§</a>

We've integrated ripa's impulse-model [PC speaker patch](https://www.vogons.org/viewtopic.php?f=41&t=23371) alongside DOSBox's existing (discrete-model) PC speaker implementation, which is still the default.

To use it, set the `pcspeaker` conf setting to `impulse` (or go back to default with `discrete`).

James-F and VileRancour have mentioned in the linked thread that it generally improves accuracy of  square-wave effects, such as in Commander Keen and Duke Nukem (2D). This patch also can produce sounds when none previously existed, such as in Wizball, as noted by ripsaw8080.

For example, here's Wizball using the settings below:

```ini
[mixer]
rate = 32000

[speaker]
pcspeaker = discrete
```

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1557255/189939873-0b751e1a-8d06-4988-a5f6-37f2945f6276.mp4

There are some audible regressions and harmonics that still exist in some games, so that's why this is an alternative and not the default.

### Audio mute and pause

The audio stream can now be manually muted with **Ctrl + F8** (or **Cmd + F8** on macOS).

You can also mute the audio automatically when DOSBox Staging goes to the background with this conf setting:

```ini
[sdl]
mute_when_inactive = true
```

Or you can pause emulation entirely when in the background with:

```ini
[sdl]
pause_when_inactive = true
```

### Configurable soft-modem connect speed

The soft-modem's reported connect speed can be customized using serial port's `baudrate:` setting. for example:

```ini
serial1 = modem baudrate:2400
```

This doesn't actually change the underling baud rate and instead is purely cosmetic to satify old modem software.

Ref: https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging/pull/1780

### Workaround for games that corrupt memory

Extremely rare programming bugs in some DOS games (and programs) may cause them to accidentally write data beyond their allocated memory region, similar to "painting outside the lines".  DOSBox is great at catching these instances: it flags the corruption in the memory chain block (MCB) and quits, preventing the program from barreling on possibling doing more harm, such as writing corrupt savegames documents, and so on.

DOSBox Staging now lets you decide if you'd rather barrel on with the `mcb_fault_strategy` setting in the [dosbox] section. The default setting, `"deny"`, maintains the existing safe behavior of quiting as soon as a fault is detected. You can also choose to `"repair"` MCB corruption (this uses simple logic and only will do 100 corrections), `"report"` MCB corruption (but carry on without repairing it), or `"allow"` MCB corruption without reporting it.

You only need to consider this if your game consistently crashes with MCB chain corruption errors.

## Developer-related features

### Self-documenting bit-twidling with `bit_view`

We've implemented a `bit_view` C++ class using constant expressions to access a subset of a data-field's bits, allowing them to be read, written, assigned, flipped, cleared, and tested, without the need to for the usual twiddling operations.

Constructing a `bit_view` is similar to C bitfields, however unlike C bitfields, `bit_view`s are free from undefined behavior and have been proven using GCC's and Clang's undefined behavior sanitizers.

There's more detail and some code examples here: https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging/pull/1708

### Memory block and type size simplification

- DOS's emulated main memory (up to 64 MiB) and the video card's memory (to up 8 MiB) is now allocated statically, to reduce pressure on heap storage. [Ref: https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging/pull/1714]

- More progress has been made in reducing the use of large variables type-sizes down to purpose-fit sizes per the DOS/hardware specification (typically 8 or 16-bit).
  https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging/pull/1721

### Tracy profiler integration

The [Tracy event profiler](https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy) has been integrated into the build system and basic hooks are in place to log frames and tics. These are only active (and not compiled in) unless Tracy is enabled.

Here's what it looks like:

[![tracy](/tracy-min.png)][tracy]

Tracy runtime-profiling DOSBox Staging

It can be enabled at build-time with `-Dtracy=true`. Learn more about it, and how to build the server-side component here: https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging/pull/1749
