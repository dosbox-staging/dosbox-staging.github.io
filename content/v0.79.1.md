## Summary

We recommend repository maintainers move to 0.79.1, which should be much easier to package. Details in the Packaging section below.

We recommend users of our zip, dmg, and Windows installer packages upgrade from 0.79.0 to fix some audio and usability bugs.

This maintenance release was made possible by everyone who tried 0.79.0, submitted bugs and pull requests, and tested the updates: thank you!

### Packaging Fixes

- Adjusted Meson's FluidSynth dependency spec to match upstream's packaging (Kirk Klobe)

- Switched Meson to use shared (instead of static) libraries by default (kcgen)
- Fixed installation of `resources` when using `meson install` (kcgen, Eli Schwartz)

Packagers will get shared libs and installed resources with these standard steps:

```shell
meson setup --prefix /writable/install/path build
meson install -C build
```
