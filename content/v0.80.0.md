##  2. <a name='Summary'></a>Summary

ReelMagic DOS games are now playable thanks to the efforts of Jon Dennis, Chris
Guthrie, and Joseph Whittaker, with testing and feedback from Vogons users Uka,
DonutKing, and Vetz. Mouse emulation has been improved and now supports up to
seven independent mice, enabling split-screen play in games like The Settlers
and The Settlers II. More settings, including video, audio, and MIXER effects,
can now be changed on the fly. A new `--working-dir` command line flag allows
DOSBox Staging to launch from a specific working directory. Repo packagers
should note that `SDL2-image` is now a dependency.
 
Read on for all the details!

##  3. <a name='Howtoupgrade'></a>How to upgrade

Get started by downloading the latest version and updating your configuration
file:

###  3.1. <a name='Downloads'></a>Downloads

* [Linux](/downloads/linux/)
* [Windows](/downloads/windows/)
* [macOS](/downloads/macos/)

###  3.2. <a name='Upgradeyourconfigurationfile'></a>Upgrade your configuration file

1. Launch the new release.
2. At the`Z:\>` prompt, run: `config -wc` to write the new configuration file. 

Notes:

- Existing settings will be retained, but extraneous comments will be dropped.

- Starting with version 0.80, the configuration file is written in the language
  in which DOSBox Staging was started.
- To write an English configuration file, launch with the `-lang en`
  command-line flag (to start DOSBox Staging in English) and then (re-)write
  your configuration file.


##  4. <a name='Newfeatures'></a>New features


###  4.1. <a name='ReelMagicsupport'></a>ReelMagic support

DOS ReelMagic games are now playable thanks to Jon Dennis's
[patch](https://github.com/jrdennisoss/dosboxrm) with help from Chris Guthrie
and Joseph Whittaker.

See the `[reelmagic]` section in your configuration file to enable this. We
suggest only enabling ReelMagic emulation on an as-needed basis.

<video controls width=640>
  <source src="/reelmagic_rtz.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the <code>video</code> element.
</video>

Jon plans to add DMA support (primarily used by the ReelMagic Win 3.1 driver and
games) when time permits, but most ReelMagic games for DOS are already fully
functional and playable.

###  4.2. <a name='Mouseimprovements'></a>Mouse improvements

####  4.2.1. <a name='Dedicatedconfigurationsection'></a>Dedicated configuration section

The mouse configuration has been moved to its own section and additional options
have been added. A tool called `mousectl` is available on `Z:\>` for more
detailed per-interface mouse configuration.
 
####  4.2.2. <a name='Dualmousegaming'></a>Dual mouse gaming

Multiple physical mice can now be mapped to specific emulated mouse interfaces,
enabling two-player split-screen gaming (The Settlers and The Settlers II) using
two USB mice on a single computer.

<video controls width=640>
  <source src="/dual_mouse_s2.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the <code>video</code> element.
</video>

See the [wiki article](https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging/wiki/Dual-Mouse-Gaming) for more details.


####  4.2.3. <a name='Improvedsupportfor3rdpartyINT33Windowsmousedriver'></a>Improved support for 3rd party INT33 Windows mouse driver
 
@javispedro's [INT33 mouse
driver](https://git.javispedro.com/cgit/vbados.git/about/) for Windows 3.1x is
fully supported and no longer requires the use of the separate DOS driver,
except when booting from a disk image. The driver also resolves compatibility
issues with seamless mouse integration and adds mouse wheel support.

See the [wiki article](https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging/wiki/Windows-3.1x#improved-mouse-driver) for more details.

####  4.2.4. <a name='Mouse-relatedhelpinthetitlebar'></a>Mouse-related help in the title bar

The title bar now displays some short help about the mouse, such as how it can
be captured or released.

###  4.3. <a name='AbilitytouselocalconfigsviaFinderonmacOS'></a>Ability to use local configs via Finder on macOS

A new `--working-dir <path>` command line parameter has been introduced to make
it possible to launch DOSBox Staging using local configs from the Finder on
macOS. Previously, you had to use DOSBox from the command line to achieve this.
 
####  4.3.1. <a name='Howtouseit'></a>How to use it

Follow the steps indicated in the DMG package, as shown: 

[![macOS DMG run-command tip](/macos_dmg_run_command.png)](/macos_dmg_run_command.png)

Simply copy the included `Start DOSBox Staging.command` to any folder that
contains a local `dosbox.conf` and then open it (`Start DOSBox Staging.command`)
in Finder. DOSBox Staging will act as if started from that folder and will pick
up the local config.
 
Note: you might be asked to give DOSBox Staging access to the containing folder
upon the first launch — just click OK if that dialog comes up.

 
##  5. <a name='Generalimprovements'></a>General improvements

###  5.1. <a name='more.comcommand'></a>`more.com` command

The `more` command is now internally implemented (should be more user-friendly
than the original DOS one), and its engine is used for displaying help messages
longer than one screen.

<video controls width=640>
  <source src="/enhanced_more.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the <code>video</code> element.
</video>

###  5.2. <a name='On-the-flychanges'></a>On-the-fly changes

Several settings can be safely adjusted at runtime, including the output video
settings, resolution, GL shaders, audio devices, and MIXER settings.

<video controls width=640>
  <source src="/plug_n_play_audio.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the <code>video</code> element.
</video>

###  5.3. <a name='Post-renderedscreenshots'></a>Post-rendered screenshots

DOSBox has long provided the Ctrl+F5 hotkey to capture the emulated video card's
image prior to rendering.

DOSBox Staging 0.80 now pairs this with Alt+F5 (or Cmd+F5 on macOS) to capture
the as-seen (post-rendered) image.

###  5.4. <a name='MorebundledOpenGLshaders'></a>More bundled OpenGL shaders

The balance of usable shaders from Tyrells' CRT shader collection, as well as
GranMinigun's interpolating Catmull–Rom spline shader have been added.

Launch DOSBox Staging with the `--list-glshaders` command-line argument to list
the available OpenGL shaders. For example:

``` text

##  6. <a name='Bugandregressionfixes'></a>Bug and regression fixes

- The mixer's effects (reverb, chorus, crossfeed) can now be turned on and off
  at runtime via the MIXER command.

- FluidSynth's specific reverb and chorus configuration settings are now applied
  and will replace the default values that were previously always applied.

- The modem's call now has a warm-up period where it will discard data. This
  fixes a bug noted in Duke Nukem 3D where it would fail its initial handshake
  in the first try.

##  7. <a name='Translationimprovements'></a>Translation improvements

Translations:
* German: up-to-date
* Italian: up-to-date
* Polish: up-to-date
* Russian: up-to-date
* French: not updated
* Spanish: not updated

Related improvements:

- The title bar is now translatable.

- The Brazilian ABNT2 slash and question mark keys are now handled.

- Translations are now stored in UTF-8 and converted to the selected DOS
  codepage, dropping accents if needed, sometimes even performing crude
  transliterations - for Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic alphabets emulator shouldn't
  display garbled messages anymore regardless which codepage is selected. This
  is especially important for languages where more than one incompatible
  encoding was used in the DOS era. All FreeDOS codepages are supported.
  Note that only DOSBox Staging's own messages benefit from this feature.
