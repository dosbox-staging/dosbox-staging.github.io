And why are there black borders around it? (Well, that\u2019s two questions, but nevermind.)</p> <p>Computer monitors were originally not widescreen but had a 4:3 display aspect ratio, just like old television sets. The complete switch to 16:9 in computer monitors and laptops happened only by the early 2010s. The low-resolution 320\u00d7200 VGA mode was designed to completely fill a 4:3 CRT screen. When displaying such 4:3 aspect ratio content on a 16:9 modern flat panel, it\u2019s inevitable to get black bars on the sides of the image (this is called pillarboxing).</p> <p></p> <p>Pillarboxing in action: black bars fill the extra spacewhen the aspect ratio of the screen and the image do not match   </p> <p>Hang on a second, something is not right here\u2026 320:200 can be simplified to 16:10, which is quite close to 16:9, which means 320\u00d7200 resolution content should fill a 16:9 screen almost completely with only very minor pillarboxing! Sure, that would be true if the pixels of the 320\u00d7200 VGA mode were perfect little squares, but they are not. How so?</p> <p>As mentioned, 320\u00d7200 graphics completely fills the screen on a 4:3 aspect ratio CRT\u2014that\u2019s only possible if the pixels are not perfect squares, but slightly tall rectangles. With square pixels, you\u2019d get some letterboxing below the image (the horizontal version of pillarboxing) as shown on the below image. If you do the maths, it turns out the pixels need to be exactly 20% taller than wide.</p> <p></p> <p>Left: 320\u00d7200 pixel image with square pixels on a 4:3 monitor\u2014there   is some letterboxing below the image; Right: the same image with 20% taller   pixels on the same monitor\u2014the image fills the screen completely   </p> <p>Here\u2019s how to derive it: 4:3 can be rewritten as 320:240 if you multiply both the numerator and denominator by 80. Then 240 divided by 200 is 1.2, so the pixel aspect ratio, or PAR\u2014the mathematical ratio that describes how the width of a pixel compares to its height\u2014is 1:1.2, which can be rewritten as 5:6.</p> <p>But hey, not everybody likes maths, especially not in the middle of a gaming session! Most of the time, you won\u2019t need to worry about aspect ratio correctness because DOSBox Staging handles that automatically for you out-of-the-box. There is a small but significant number of games where overriding aspect ratio correction and forcing square pixels yields better results.</p> <p>When pixels are not squares</p> <p>Sadly, this very important fact of computing history that monitors were not widescreen until about 2010 tends to be forgotten nowadays. Older DOSBox versions did not perform aspect ratio correction by default which certainly did not help matters either. The unfortunate situation is that you\u2019re much more likely to encounter videos and screenshots of DOS games in the wrong aspect ratio (using square pixels) on the Internet today. Well, that\u2019s only true for more recently created content\u2014if you check out any old computer magazine from the 1980s and the 90s, most screenshots are shown in the correct aspect ratio (but rarely the magazines got it wrong too\u2026)</p> <p>In case you\u2019re wondering, pixels are completely square in 640\u00d7480 and higher resolutions (1:1 pixel aspect ratio), but there exist a few more weird video modes with non-square pixels, e.g., the 640\u00d7350 EGA mode with 1:1.3714 PAR, the 640\u00d7200 EGA mode (1:2.4 PAR), and the 720\u00d7348 Hercules graphics mode (1:1.5517 PAR).</p>"},{"location":"getting-started/advanced-graphics-options/#integer-scaling","title":"Integer scaling","text":"<p>That explains the black bars on the sides, but what about the letterboxing I sometimes see above and below the image? Why doesn\u2019t the graphics fill the screen vertically and why does it change size, depending on the DOS video mode? </p> <p>Again, we need a little history lesson to understand what\u2019s going on. CRT monitors did not have a fixed pixel-grid like modern flat panels; they were a lot more flexible and could display any resolution within the physical limits of the monitor. In fact, they did not even have discrete \u201cpixels\u201d in the sense as modern flat panels do\u2014the image was literally projected onto the screen, similarly to how movie a projector works.</p> <p>Modern flat screens, however, do have a fixed native resolution, and the scanlines of the emulated CRT image need to \u201cline up\u201d with this fixed pixel grid vertically, otherwise we might get quite unpleasant looking interference artifacts (these usually manifest as wavy vertical patterns). When DOSBox Staging enlarges the emulated image to fill the screen, by default it constrains the vertical scaling factor to integer values; this ensures perfect alignment with the native pixel grid of the display. The horizontal direction is rarely a problem, so non-integer horizontal scaling factors are generally fine. </p> <p>Assuming a 4K monitor with 3840\u00d72160 native resolution, the 320\u00d7200 VGA mode double-scanned to 640\u00d7400 will be enlarged by a factor of 5 vertically, and by a 5 \u00d7 4/3 = 6.6667 factor horizontally to maintain the correct 4:3 aspect ratio of the upscaled image. The final output will be 2667\u00d72000, so those 160 unused pixels in the vertical direction account for the slight letterboxing above and below the image.</p> <p>Now, the higher your monitor resolution, the more you can get away with using non-integer vertical scaling ratios. It\u2019s just that enabling vertical integer scaling by default is the only surefire way to completely avoid ugly interefence artifacts on everybody\u2019s monitors out-of-the-box. If you play games in fullscreen on a 4K screen, you can safely disable integer scaling without any adverse effects up to the 640\u00d7480 VGA resolution. Just put the following into your config:</p> <pre><code>[render]\ninteger_scaling = off\n</code></pre> <p>If you don\u2019t have a 4K or monitor or you like to play your games in windowed mode, you\u2019ll need to experiment a bit\u2014some monitor resolution, window size, and DOS video mode combinations look fine without integer scaling, some will result in interference patterns.</p>"},{"location":"getting-started/advanced-graphics-options/#sharp-pixels","title":"Sharp pixels","text":"<p>Okay, enough blabbering about all those near-extinct, mythical  cathode-ray tube contraptions, grandpa.

Basically, you want the resulting image to measure about 12 inches (30 cm) diagonally for the most authentic results. But alas, that would be a tad too small for most people. 960\u00d7720 would result in a non-integer vertical scale factor, anyway, which to be avoided.

The <code>viewport</code> setting adopts the same approach; the viewport size must be always specified in logical units.</p> <p>For example, on a 4K display, a viewport resolution specified as <code>1280x960</code> logical units will translate to 2560\u00d71920 physical pixels (assuming a typical 200% scaling factor). Then on 1080p with a 100% scaling factor, it will simply translate to 1280\u00d7960 pixels.</p> <p>Maths time!</p> <p>This is hardcore mode\u2014only for the brave and the mathematically-inclined shall prevail!</p> <ul> <li>Assuming a 1920\u00d71080 desktop resolution, <code>viewport = 80%</code> will restrict   the maximum viewport size to 1536\u00d7864 logical units.</li> <li>The viewport size is a potential. With integer scaling disabled and aspect ratio   correction enabled, for a 4:3 aspect ratio DOS image you\u2019d get a   1152\u00d7864 image in logical units (because 1152 / 864 = 4/3).</li> <li>This would result in  1152\u00d7864 pixels on 1080p monitors, then on 4K   monitors with 200% DPI scaling, the resulting image would be 2304\u00d71728   pixels.</li> <li>With integer scaling enabled and assuming a 320\u00d7200 input image,   864 / 200 = 4.32, so a 4x vertical integer scaling factor will be used.

You can press F5 to bring up the game\u2019s options dialog where you can lower the music volume, but that would make the total audio output too quiet. Worse yet, the setting doesn\u2019t get saved, so you\u2019d need to do this every single time when starting up the game.</p> <p>As we\u2019ve learned before, games with Sound Blaster support tend to use the sound card\u2019s OPL synthesiser for the music and its digital audio capabilities for the speech. As the OPL synth and the digital audio have their dedicated mixer channels, their volumes can be adjusted independently of each other.</p> <p>\u201cWait a minute, what mixer channels now?!\u201d</p> <p>Okay, so DOSBox has an integrated audio mixer. All emulated sound cards have their own channels in the mixer, and certain \u201ccomposite\u201d audio devices may have multiple channels. The Sound Blaster is such a composite device, so it has two mixer channels: one for the OPL synthesiser, and one for digital audio.</p> <p>Execute the <code>mixer</code> command in the DOS prompt to view the current state of the mixer:</p> <p></p> <p>The first channel is the <code>MASTER</code> channel; this is the summed output of all other channels and it\u2019s always present.

Older games released before about 1993 use something called real mode, while newer games released from 1993 onwards use protected mode. The important distinction here is that most CPU-hungry games are protected mode games (e.g., FPS games and flight simulators), while older pre-1993 real mode games generally have much less demanding performance requirements. Figuring out what exact CPU speed a particular game needs is almost impossible at the emulator level, but detecting whether a game uses real or protected mode is trivial. Therefore, DOSBox does the following automatic speed calibration by default:</p> <ul> <li> <p>For real mode games, it defaults to emulating 3000 CPU instructions   per millisecond.</p> </li> <li> <p>For protected mode games, it emulates as many CPU instructions as it can   per millisecond.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The reasoning here is that older games are often sensitive to CPU speed; they might run too fast or misbehave if the CPU is too performant, hence the more conservative setting. Newer, more demanding games, however, benefit from the extra speed advantage and can generally handle faster processors without negative side effects.</p> <p>While this approach generally gets all games running, manual tweaking of the emulated CPU speed is often required to make any particular game run smoothly. Protected mode games running at the maximum emulable CPU speed are particularly problematic because there might not be enough power left for smooth, glitch-free audio emulation. There\u2019s zero point in emulating a faster CPU than what the game needs as all that extra work could be put to better use\u2014such as smoother audio emulation.</p> <p>Beyond a Steel Sky is a protected mode game, but how we do know that? Let\u2019s comment out the last <code>sky</code> command in the <code>[autoexec]</code> section to prevent the game from auto-starting, then launch DOSBox Staging in windowed mode. DOSBox itself always starts in real mode, and let\u2019s take a look at the text in the DOSBox window\u2019s title bar! It starts with the following:</p> <pre><code>DOSBOX - 3000 cycles/ms\n</code></pre> <p>Remember what we learned earlier: in real mode, DOSBox defaults to emulating 3000 CPU instructions, or cycles, per millisecond. The text in the title bar tells us the current cycles value, so indeed, we must be running in real mode now!</p> <p>Now start the game with the <code>sky</code> command and keep your eyes peeled on the title bar. The text will soon change to the following:</p> <pre><code>SKY - max 100%\n</code></pre> <p><code>SKY</code> is the name of the executable that\u2019s running, and what do we see after that? <code>max 100%</code>! That\u2019s the tell-tale sign of a protected mode game because, as mentioned, DOSBox tries to emulate the fastest CPU it can in protected mode.</p> <p>And that\u2019s the crux of the problem\u2014there\u2019s not enough horsepower left to emulate the time-critical audio output without stuttering and glitches. The solution is kind of obvious: instead of letting DOSBox run amok with the CPU emulation, we\u2019ll restrict it to a reasonable speed.</p> <p>We do that by specifying the number of CPU instructions, or cycles, to emulate per millisecond with the following config snippet:</p> <pre><code>[cpu]\ncycles = 12000\n</code></pre> <p>Restart DOSBox Staging and do the \u201cdoor test\u201d again. All the audio glitches are now gone! Well done, time for a beer (or your beverage of choice)!  </p> <p>Real and protected mode</p> <p>In very simple terms, real mode is a programming model that uses the legacy 16-bit mode of an Intel 386 or later CPU, while protected mode takes full advantage of its capabilities and runs in 32-bit mode. Protected mode is the real deal, but it couldn\u2019t be universally utilised until 386 or better CPUs had gained widespread adoption. That happened around the year 1993; games released from thereon use protected mode almost exclusively.</p> <p>You can easily spot protected mode games by the presence of so-called DOS extenders in their main game directories. <code>DOS4GW.EXE</code>, <code>PMODEW.EXE</code>, and <code>CWSDPMI.EXE</code> were the most popular ones.</p> <p>But you don\u2019t need to worry about all that detail as DOSBox will indicate with 100% accuracy whether a game runs in real or protected mode. Just set <code>cycles</code> to <code>auto</code>, then watch the title bar of the DOSBox Staging window while running the game.</p>"},{"location":"getting-started/beneath-a-steel-sky/#finding-the-correct-speed-for-a-game","title":"Finding the correct speed for a game","text":"<p>Ok, so why 12\u2009000 and not any other number?

You\u2019ll get used to it.</p> <p>This particular game turns things up a notch and does not copy the installer/setup utility into <code>C:\\SKY</code> as one would rightly expect. To reconfigure the game, you need to run <code>INSTALL.EXE</code> from the CD, so from the D drive (I\u2019ve told you\u2014setting up the game itself is part of the adventure!)</p> <p>So let\u2019s do that. As we\u2019ve already installed the game on our C drive, we\u2019ll need to press Esc instead of Enter in the first Path Selection Window. Not exactly intuitive, but whatever. Now we\u2019re in the Setup Menu screen where we can change the language and configure the sound options. Select Roland sound, then press the Exit Install and Save Setup buttons to save your settings (don\u2019t even get me started\u2026)</p> <p>Okay, now the moment of truth: start the game with the <code>sky</code> command. If nothing went sideways, we should hear the much-improved, glorious MT-32 soundtrack! Now we\u2019re cooking with gas!</p> <p>So let\u2019s inspect our favourite door one more time\u2014hey, where did the voice-over go?! Yeah\u2026 you\u2019ve probably glossed over this little detail in the tip from the MT-32 wiki page:</p> <p>Combined MT-32/SB output only possible using ScummVM</p> <p>What this means for us ordinary mortals is that in the original game you can either use MT-32 for music and sound effects, and you get no speech; or you can use Sound Blaster for music, sound effects, and speech. MT-32 music and sound effects with speech via the Sound Blaster\u2014that\u2019s a no-go.</p> <p>The game has just taught us an important life lesson: you can\u2019t have everything, especially not in the world of older DOS games. You\u2019ll have to pick what you value most: better music and only subtitles, or full voice-acting with a slightly worse soundtrack. I\u2019m opting for the latter, and remember, we can always improve the Sound Blaster / AdLib music by adding chorus and reverb. This will get us a little bit closer to the MT-32 soundtrack:</p> <pre><code>[mixer]\nreverb = large\nchorus = strong\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"getting-started/beneath-a-steel-sky/#aspect-ratio-correction","title":"Aspect ratio correction","text":"<p>We\u2019re on a roll here; the game seems to provide us with endless education opportunities. We\u2019ll divert our eyes (ears?) from the audio to the graphics next!</p> <p>If you\u2019ve checked out the comic book included with the game (and you definitely should!) and you have a keen eye for detail, you might have noticed that the images in the intro sequence, which are scanned from the comics, appear vertically stretched on-screen. In fact, they appear exactly 20% taller than they should, which means the artwork was scanned using square pixels, then the stretching happens because of the 1:1.2 pixel aspect ratio of the 320\u00d7200 VGA screen mode (you might want to revisit the detailed explanation to refresh your memory).</p> <p></p>    Left: Screenshot from the intro with aspect ratio correction disabled (square pixels)   Right: The original image from the comic book included with the game    <p>As we\u2019ve learnt previously, DOSBox Staging enables aspect ratio correction by default to make 320\u00d7200 graphics appear exactly as they would on a 4:3 aspect ratio VGA monitor, which requires pixels to be drawn 20% taller. This is the most sensible default as aspect ratio correction is absolutely needed for the vast majority of DOS games to look correct, but there are exceptions\u2014this game is one of those rare cases. We need to disable aspect ratio correction for such games. With aspect ratio correction disabled, we\u2019ll always get square pixels, no matter what (1:1 pixel aspect ratio).</p> <p>That\u2019s quite easy to do, and we\u2019re also setting the viewport resolution to 4x scaling, effectively, because the game would appear too blocky when fit to fullscreen:</p> <pre><code>[render]\naspect = off\nviewport = 1280x800\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p>Beneath a Steel Sky with 1280\u00d7800 viewport resolution restriction and aspect ratio correction disabled   </p> <p></p> <p>Beneath a Steel Sky \u2014 Well, we won\u2019t escape this way\u2026   </p> <p>Of course, this would\u2019ve been a very misguided effort if it had only fixed the intro graphics but not the in-game visuals. Fortunately, it turns out both the intro and the in-game content had been drawn assuming square pixels. For example, note how the floppy icon looks like a tallish rectangle with aspect ratio correction enabled; that\u2019s wrong, floppies should appear as perfect squares. Human figures and circular objects would also appear slightly elongated vertically with aspect ratio correction enabled. Ultimately, we know the game was developed by Revolution, a European studio, and they also released the game for PAL Amigas that have square pixels. We also know that Revolution was very fond of the Amiga, and thus can be considered an Amiga-first developer. For such games, disabling aspect ratio correction is almost always the correct answer.</p> <p>So, the rules of thumb:</p> <p><code>aspect = on</code></p> <ul> <li> <p>For most games where DOS was the leading platform. This is the DOSBox   Staging default, and it ensures the overwhelming majority of DOS games   appear correctly out of the box.</p> </li> <li> <p>For games where the leading platform was the Amiga or Atari ST, but the   game was developed by a North American studio for the NTSC standard (or the   actual work was performed by a European studio, but it was commissioned   by North Americans, and the game was primarily intended for the NTSC-only   North American market).</p> </li> </ul> <p><code>aspect = off</code></p> <ul> <li>For most games developed by European studios where the Amiga   or Atari ST was the leading platform.</li> </ul> <p>Here\u2019s a non-exclusive list of the most important Amiga-first European studios:</p> <p>Bitmap Brothers, Bullfrog, Coktel Vision, Core Design, DMA Design, Delphine, Digital Illusions, Firebird, Horror Soft / Adventure Soft, Infogrames, Level 9, Magnetic Scrolls, Ocean, Psygnosis, Revolution, Sensible Software, Silmarils, Team 17, Thalamus, Thalion, Ubisoft</p> <p>From squares to rectangles</p> <p>For the vast majority of computer games from the 80s and 90s featuring 2D graphics, the art was created once for the leading platform which was then reused in the various other platform conversions. It was just not economical to draw the graphics multiple times in different aspect ratios and resolutions, hence this was done extremely rarely.</p> <p>We explained earlier that CRT monitors in the DOS era had a 4:3 aspect ratio, so in 320\u00d7200 mode the pixels had to be 20% taller for the image to completely fill the screen. DOSBox Staging does this aspect ratio correction by default which results in games primarily developed for DOS PCs assuming 1:1.2 pixel aspect ratio to look correct (as the artist intended).</p> <p>But what about games where the leading platform was the Amiga or the Atari ST, and the game was developed by a European studio? The analog TV standard in Europe was PAL, therefore Amigas sold in Europe were PAL machines that had square pixels in the 320\u00d7256 screen mode, the resolution most commonly used by PAL Amiga games. So what these European studios usually did was to draw the art assuming square pixels, but using only a 320\u00d7200 portion of the 320\u00d7256 total available area. On PAL Amigas the art appeared in the correct aspect ratio, but letterboxed; on NTSC Amigas and DOS PCs that had the 320\u00d7200 low-res screen mode, the art filled the whole screen but appeared slightly stretched vertically (by 20%). No one seemed to complain about this, and they saved a lot of money by not having to draw the art twice, so this became a common practice.</p> <p>However, now you have the option to enjoy these games in their correct aspect ratio, as per the artists\u2019 original intention by simply disabling DOSBox Staging\u2019s default aspect ratio correction.</p> <p>Don\u2019t trust the circles!</p> <p>Even keener observers might notice the image from the intro on the left features a circle that only appears perfect with aspect ratio correction enabled, in which case the image from the comics is stretched. But with aspect ratio correction disabled (as shown above), the circle appears to be a squashed oval, but the image from the comics looks perfect.</p> <p>The explanation is simple: the person who drew the circle around the scanned image did it assuming 1:1.2 pixel aspect ratio, so it looked like a perfect circle to him on his PC VGA monitor.</p> <p>That\u2019s a common theme: some games end up with assets added to them during the porting process, which can sometimes result in mixed aspect ratio assets in a single game. Sometimes it\u2019s just impossible to make the game appear correctly using a single fixed pixel aspect ratio, especially if such mixed aspect ratio assets are being displayed on screen at the same time.</p> <p>Generally, you cannot trust the circles. Sometimes they will appear perfect when the correct aspect ratio is used, sometimes they won\u2019t. It\u2019s much more reliable to judge aspect ratio correctness by looking at common objects, human bodies, and human faces.</p>"},{"location":"getting-started/beneath-a-steel-sky/#final-configuration","title":"Final configuration","text":"<p>Putting it all together, this is our final config:</p> <pre><code>[cpu]\ncycles = 12000\n\n[sdl]\nfullscreen = on\n\n[render]\naspect = off\nviewport = 1280x800\n\n[sblaster]\nsbmixer = off\n\n[midi]\nmididevice = mt32\n\n[mt32]\nmodel = cm32l\n\n[mixer]\nreverb = large\nchorus = strong\n\n[autoexec]\nimgmount d \"cd/cdrom1.iso\" -t iso\nc:\ncd sky\nsky\nexit\n</code></pre> <p>With this config, you can switch between Roland MT-32 and Sound Blaster / AdLib sound at will by only reconfiguring the game via <code>INSTALL.EXE</code>\u2014you don\u2019t need to make any further changes to the DOSBox config.

This mode uses a fixed 70 Hz screen refresh rate, so if your emulated CPU is fast enough, you can get 70 FPS out of the game.</p> <p>But there\u2019s a problem: most modern non-variable refresh rate flat screens work at fixed 60 Hz. Luckily, DOSBox Staging intelligently times and drops frames if there\u2019s a mismatch between the refresh rate of the emulated graphics card and the actual refresh rate of your physical monitor. In most cases, this works fine out of the box without you needing to configure anything.</p> <p>However, even though DOSBox Staging is trying to do its best in such situations, refresh rates will always result in some visible unevenness of motion. This is especially noticeable in games that feature smooth scrolling (e.g., shoot\u2019em up games, platformers, and pinball games), and in fast-paced 3D games, such as Dark Forces.</p> <p>To achieve smoother motion, we have two options:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Using a variable-refresh rate (VRR) monitor \u2014 Nvidia G-Sync, AMD   FreeSync, VESA AdaptiveSync, and Apple ProMotion certified displays all   fall into this category. Any monitor that can continuously vary the   refresh rate from about 59 to 71 Hz should do the job. DOSBox Staging   automatically takes advantage of such displays by default.</p> </li> <li> <p>Using specific fixed refresh rates on non-VRR monitors \u2014 Even if   you\u2019re not a lucky owner of a VRR display, your monitor might support a   fixed 70 Hz refresh rate if you create a custom screen mode for it. This   is highly monitor dependent, but there\u2019s no harm in trying it out.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Note, however, that depending on the type of game, the 60/70 Hz mismatch might not matter much or at all. For instance, most adventure, strategy, and role-playing games rarely have fast-paced graphics; they generally only update the screen in the low 5-20 FPS range. Running the monitor at 70 Hz results in very little noticeable improvement with these games.</p> <p>Another important consideration is that most pre-VGA games don\u2019t feature smooth movement in their graphics, so the general unevenness of motion masks the slight judder resulting from the 60/70 Hz mismatch.</p> <p>For reference, these are the refresh rates of all emulated graphics cards:</p> Graphics adapter Refresh rate SVGA and VESA 70 Hz or higher \u2014 640\u00d7480 or higher extended and VESA modes VGA 60 Hz \u2014 640\u00d7480 standard mode only70 Hz \u2014 all other standard modes CGA, PCjr, Tandy, EGA 60 Hz Hercules 50 Hz <p>Creating custom 60 and 70 Hz screen modes</p> <p>\u201cCustom resolution\u201d is a bit of a misnomer because what we\u2019re after is creating a new screen mode that uses your monitor\u2019s native resolution, but with a custom refresh rate.</p> <p>You can create such custom resolutions using the Nvidia Control Panel or with the Custom Resolution Utility (CRU) on Windows. You\u2019ll probably need to enable CVT reduced blanking (CVT-RB or CVT-RBv2) to go up to 70 Hz. For the best results, it\u2019s recommended to use the exact fractional 59.713 Hz and 70.086 Hz refresh rates for the nominal \u201c60 Hz\u201d and \u201c70 Hz\u201d DOS rates, respectively.</p> <p>The drawback of this approach is that you need to set the appropriate custom resolution before starting DOSBox Staging, and if a game switches between different refresh rates, well, you\u2019re out of luck\u2014these games can only work 100% correctly either on a true VRR display or a real old-school CRT monitor. However, most games only use a single fixed refresh rate, which is usually the standard 70 Hz VGA rate, so this technique is still very practical.</p>"},{"location":"getting-started/dark-forces/#vertical-syncing","title":"Vertical syncing","text":"<p>Dark Forces synchronises its screen updates to the refresh rate of the emulated VGA card, which is always 70 Hz. This is hardcoded behaviour that cannot be disabled in the game\u2019s configuration.</p> <p>DOSBox Staging itself also uses vertical syncing by default to synchronise updating the emulated image to the vertical refresh rate of your physical monitor. Without DOSBox-level vsync, fast-paced games such as this one would exhibit a lot of tearing. This is important to understand: to get zero tearing, vertical syncing must be happening both in the game and at the DOSBox level!</p> <p>Conversely, DOSBox-level vsync only means that the emulated image is output to your physical monitor without flickering and tearing; the emulated DOS game itself might or might not use vertical syncing, and thus might or might not produce tearing artifacts of its own (these artifacts are present when running the game on real hardware too\u2014there\u2019s nothing we can do about them).</p> <p>You don\u2019t have control over the vertical syncing behaviour in most DOS games. For example, Commander Keen 4\u20136, Doom, and many other FPS games have hardcoded vsync with a fixed 35 FPS cap. These games were programmed with fixed refresh rates in mind from the ground up; trying to disable the vsync or altering the FPS cap would completely break them (but the good news is you can\u2019t do that anyway).</p> <p>To recap, the following variations are possible when it comes to vsync:</p> Game uses vsync? DOSBox-level vsync enabled? Result yes yes no tearing no yes some tearing; also present on real hardware yes no bad tearing (in fast-paced games) no no very bad double-tearing (in fast-paced games) <p>As you can see, there is no point in disabling vsync in DOSBox itself, and even with DOSBox vsync enabled you might still get tearing in some games, but that\u2019s just how the games were coded. We can\u2019t \u201cfix\u201d that at the emulator level; that would require making changes to the games\u2019 code.

Dark Forces is no exception, which means your emulated CPU needs to be fast enough to reach the 70 FPS maximum the game supports.</p> <p>The game prints out the familiar message of the DOS/4GW DOS extender at startup, which means this is a protected mode game:</p> <pre><code>DOS/4GW Protected Mode Run-Time  Version 1.95\nCopyright (c) Rational Systems, Inc. 1990-1993\n</code></pre> <p>As we\u2019ve learnt, protected mode games default to using all available CPU power. While this will most likely help achieve a stable 70 FPS (if your computer is powerful enough), running the CPU at maximum speed could starve the audio emulation, leading to audible glitches, clicks, and pops.</p> <p>To avoid such issues, it\u2019s much preferable to emulate a CPU that is powerful enough to handle 70 FPS but not more. One way to come up with a good cycles number is to start the game with a relatively low cycles setting, say 10\u2009000, then keep increasing it with the Ctrl+F12 shortcut (Cmd+F12 on the Mac) while playing to arrive at the lowest value that results in adequate performance. As a reminder, you can decrease the current cycles value too with the Ctrl+F11 (Cmd+F11) shortcut.</p> <p>So let\u2019s add the following to our config:</p> <pre><code>[cpu]\ncycles = 10000\n</code></pre> <p>Start the game and hold the Left or Right key to keep turning around, then increase the cycles value until the motion becomes smooth (again, unless you\u2019re using a VRR monitor or a fixed 70 Hz refresh rate, it will never become completely smooth). Somewhere around 50\u2009000 cycles seems to do the trick, which roughly corresponds to a Pentium 90 based on our table of common processors.</p> <p>So we\u2019ll go with that setting. You might need to increase this if later levels are more demanding on the CPU, but this is a good starting point:</p> <pre><code>[cpu]\ncycles = 50000\n</code></pre> <p>Running out of steam</p> <p>As you keep increasing the fixed cycles value, the audio will start breaking up, and the motion will become very stuttery after a certain point. This means you\u2019re trying to emulate a faster CPU than your computer can handle. If you\u2019re on a less powerful machine, this unfortunately can happen before reaching the minimum cycles value necessary for a smooth and stable 70 FPS.</p> <p>You have only two options in this situation: live with a lower cycles setting that results in less than 70 FPS, or buy a more powerful computer with a faster processor that can handle higher cycles values.</p> <p>Also, make sure you\u2019re not running any other CPU-intensive programs at the same time in the background. Virus scanners, backup software, copying large files to USB storage, heavy network traffic, and even ordinary web browsers with many tabs open can chew up a significant part of your total CPU power. Certain popular chat programs can be very demanding on the CPU too, and, surprisingly, even innocent-looking stuff such as automatic wallpaper changers can have negative effects on the performance of DOSBox.</p> <p>As a general rule, it\u2019s best to close all other programs if you\u2019re encountering performance issues with DOSBox and try again.

A few SoundFonts are extremely loud\u2014you need to turn the FluidSynth volume down to 10-20% to get usable levels. It\u2019s a mystery what the authors were thinking\u2026</p> <p>Roland MT-32 is not General MIDI</p> <p>Do not confuse the Roland MT-32 family of MIDI sound modules with General MIDI modules! Music composed for the MT-32 sounds utterly wrong on a General MIDI module, and vice versa. Yes, they both have \u201cMIDI\u201d in their names, but that only refers to the communication protocol. The MT-32 range of devices are fully programmable synthesisers and most games take advantage of their sound-shaping capabilities, while the General MIDI modules have much more modest synthesis capabilities, but feature more realistic-sounding real-world instruments (the soundtrack of Dark Forces showcases this very well\u2014you just can\u2019t get such realistic orchestral music out of an MT-32).</p> <p>Whenever you want to configure a new game for MIDI sound, you should consult the list of MT-32-compatible computer games to see if the game was originally composed for the MT-32 or a General MIDI device (typically the SC-55). The original game manuals very rarely give you this info, so you absolutely need this list that contains the hard-earned knowledge of many decades of research and testing.</p> <p>Quite confusingly, there\u2019s an alarmingly large list of games that falsely claim MT-32 compatibility in their setup utility, but they in fact require a General MIDI module to sound correct. Before you configure any game for MT-32 sound, you should definitely check the list of games that falsely claim MT-32 compatibility too, no matter what the game\u2019s manual says (quite often, the information contained therein is simply wrong).</p> <p>A brief history of MIDI in DOS gaming</p> <p>In the beginning, the iconic Roland MT-32 family of devices were the only MIDI sound modules available for DOS games that made realistic-sounding music a possibility. The original MT-32 was released in 1987, and its hegemony ended in 1991 with Roland unleashing its successor, the similarly iconic Roland Sound Canvas SC-55.</p> <p>The SC-55 was another pioneering effort that shaped DOS gaming history in significant ways: it was the world\u2019s first device to support the General MIDI standard and the GS standard (the latter being Roland\u2019s vendor-specific General MIDI extensions). MIDI in the broadest sense only defines a communication mechanism between MIDI-capable devices (e.g., a sound module and your computer), but remains silent on how the different instruments should sound. General MIDI (GM) remedied this with its 128 standard instrument definitions; for example, you can be sure that on any GM-compliant module instrument #1 is the Acoustic Grand Piano and instrument #36 is the Fretless Bass.</p> <p>This made interoperation between GM-compliant devices possible. In theory, you could use any General MIDI sound module with any GM-compliant game, and you would get music, and it would sound mostly correct. In practice, that \u201cmostly\u201d part is highly variable and it depends on the musical composition and the particular sound module in use. The thing is, most composers and gamers had the SC-55, establishing it as a de-facto standard (understandably, because it was the very first GM module). Other GM sound modules can render musical compositions written for the SC-55 unbalanced and weird-sounding, depending on how different their instruments sound compared to the \u201cstandard\u201d SC-55.</p> <p>Another thing that makes compatibility difficult to achieve is that the SC-55 supports not just the GM but also the GS standard, and many games make good use of certain GS-only features. This means that any other General MIDI module that claims \u201cSound Canvas compatibility\u201d also has to implement the GS standard in a manner that sounds very close to the SC-55, which is not always the case.</p>"},{"location":"getting-started/dark-forces/#dynamic-range-compression","title":"Dynamic range compression","text":"<p>If a game has loud music and you set the output level of your soundcard too high, you\u2019ll get rather unpleasant-sounding distortion and crackling on real hardware. DOSBox Staging has a dynamic range compressor on the master channel that automatically pulls the volume back on loud sounds to prevent such distortion from happening.</p> <p>You can test this by playing the game for a minute with the GeneralUser GS SoundFont. You might notice a slight \u201cpumping\u201d as the compressor pulls the volume back on loud sound effects; this dips the volume level of the background music as well.</p> <p>To hear the distortion caused by the loud sounds clearly, disable the master compressor:</p> <pre><code>[mixer]\ncompressor = off\n</code></pre> <p>Overall, the compressor does a good job of preventing audible distortion up to a certain point, and most users should not think much about it; it just works.

You said Sound Blaster, so what\u2019s this AdLib thing now?!\u201d</p> <p>Okay, we\u2019ll need to understand a few technical details again. Most Sound Blaster cards support at least two sound generation mechanisms:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Playing digitised sounds (sounds recorded from real-world sources, such     as speech, sound effects, and sometimes even recorded music). This is     referred to as digital audio, digitised sound, sampled audio, PCM     audio, or just voice or speech in the game manuals and setup     utilities (yes, it\u2019s all over the place; I\u2019m sure there are a dozen more     variations out there\u2026)</p> </li> <li> <p>Playing music and sound effects using a built-in synthesiser. This is     usually called AdLib, OPL synthesiser, FM synthesiser, simply just     music, or somewhat confusingly Sound Blaster MIDI.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Storing music as a list of instructions for a synthesiser takes very little disk space (think of sheet music), whereas storing digital audio eats disk space for breakfast (think of uncompressed audio files). Consequently, the vast majority of DOS games use some kind of synthesiser for music, and digital audio is generally reserved for sound effects and speech only.</p> <p>These game demos don\u2019t have any digital sound effects; they all just use the OPL chip of the Sound Blaster for both music and some limited sound effects. The game is clever enough to auto-detect our OPL-equipped Sound Blaster 16 (the default sound card emulated by DOSBox), so we\u2019ll get OPL sound by simply just starting <code>SAMPLER.EXE</code>.</p> <p>Of course, we can enhance the OPL music by adding reverb and chorus effects to it, just as we\u2019ve done with Prince of Persia. Unless you\u2019re an absolute purist, this is generally a good idea, especially when using headphones. We\u2019ll only need to add a few lines to our config:</p> <pre><code>[mixer]\nreverb = medium\nchorus = normal\n</code></pre> <p>Note</p> <p>Prince of Persia can also auto-detect our Sound Blaster 16, but most games are not this clever. As we\u2019ll see in our later game examples, usually we need to manually configure the audio devices using the game\u2019s setup utility.</p> <p>1-minute Sound Blaster OPL synthesiser crash course</p> <p>In case you\u2019re wondering:</p> <ul> <li> <p>OPL is just the name of the Yamaha OPL sound synthesiser chip present     on most Sound Blaster cards.</p> </li> <li> <p>AdLib was an early sound card predating Sound Blasters that featured     the same OPL chip. Perfect AdLib compatibility was one of the Sound     Blasters\u2019 main selling points, therefore in games that support both     AdLib and Sound Blaster for synthesised sound, both options will     usually yield the exact same results.</p> <p>The AdLib card, however, had no support for digital audio, so it\u2019s preferable to pick the Sound Blaster option if the game offers both\u2014 you might also get digital speech and sound effects that way.</p> </li> <li> <p>Sound Blaster MIDI is a weird thing. Most later games after 1992     supported much higher quality MIDI sound modules that used sampled     recordings of real-world instruments. Many of these also provided a     fallback option to play the same MIDI music via the OPL chip, using     synthesised approximations of the same instruments.</p> </li> <li> <p>FM refers to the type of sound synthesis the OPL chip is doing, which     is Frequency Modulation synthesis (or FM synthesis, in short).</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"getting-started/passport-to-adventure/#pc-speaker-sound","title":"PC speaker sound","text":"<p>The observant among you might have spotted the list of graphics and sound configuration options in <code>README.TXT</code>.

While many of these VGA versions are competent, they rarely reach the artistic genius of the EGA originals, plus often they don\u2019t have the exact same gameplay either. This is especially true for the three classic LucasArts games included in this demo collection. You can check out the comparison and analysis of the EGA versus VGA versions of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade and Loom here.</p> <p>In another article, Brian Moriatry, the creator of Loom, shares his opinion about the VGA remake of the game (he calls it \u201can abomination\u201d, so apparently he\u2019s quite unimpressed\u2026)</p> <p>In any case, the point here is it would be a mistake to outright dismiss the original EGA experiences, thinking they are \u201cinferior\u201d somehow.

We\u2019ll use <code>DOS Games</code> throughout this guide, but you can pick any name you like. It\u2019s best to create this folder in your regular documents folder so DOSBox Staging has full read and write access to it (don\u2019t put it in a system folder, e.g., <code>Program Files</code> on Windows). Each game will have its dedicated subfolder under <code>DOS Games</code>, so let\u2019s create our first one called <code>Prince of Persia</code>.</p> <p>Now download pop1.zip from the Prince of Persia demo page and extract its contents into <code>DOS Games/Prince of Persia</code>. The archive contains only two files: <code>pop1.txt</code> (a regular text file) and <code>pop1demo.exe</code> (an MS-DOS executable).

As indicated by the second paragraph, this is a fully playable demo version that includes only the first two levels of the game. That\u2019s more than enough for our purposes here; you can always get the full game later.</p> <p>But there are no further instructions, so what should we do next? Well, setting up old DOS games is not all that dissimilar to solving adventure game puzzles. Getting past these puzzles requires some logical thinking, a little bit of background knowledge, and an element of trial and error is occasionally involved as well. Well, the user manual often helps too if you happen to own the original or can procure a scanned copy online (most often you can).</p> <p>Luckily, this is an easy one: executable files (programs or scripts you can start) under MS-DOS have the <code>.EXE</code>, <code>.COM</code> or <code>.BAT</code> file extension.

This is called mounting; we mount a folder as the \u201cDOS hard drive\u201d, the contents of which are then available to DOSBox as the C drive. All drives in DOS are assigned to the letters of the English alphabet (just like in Windows) and the C drive is usually your first hard drive.</p> <p>The recommended way to mount the C drive is to create a <code>drives</code> subfolder inside your game folder. This <code>drives</code> folder is a \u201cmagic\u201d folder with a special purpose: all its subfolders having single-letter names are automatically mounted as DOS drives with the same letter. In our case, we only need a single C drive, so we\u2019ll create a <code>c</code> subfolder inside our <code>drives</code> folder (technically, it does not make a difference whether you use uppercase or lowercase <code>C</code> on Windows and macOS but it does in Linux). We\u2019ll then copy the files from the <code>pop1.zip</code> archive into <code>drives/c</code> to end up with the following folder structure:</p> <p></p> <p>Origins of the C drive</p> <p>Have you ever wondered where the \u201cC drive\u201d in Windows got its name from? This is something Windows inherited from its MS-DOS heritage (which in turn inherited it from CP/M). In DOS, all drives are assigned letters from A to Z. Most computers of the era had two floppy drives, so letters A and B were reserved for them or other removable media, and the first hard drive partition was usually assigned to the letter C. We no longer have floppy drives in our computers as standard equipment, but this tradition stuck around for backwards-compatibility reasons.</p> <p>Important</p> <p>If you\u2019re a Windows user, do not confuse your real C drive where your operating system and programs are stored with the \u201cvirtual DOS C drive\u201d of DOSBox. It is important to understand the distinction between these two as they are completely separate concepts\u2014DOSBox will not see the contents of your real C drive by default (or the contents of any of your other drives, for that matter).</p>"},{"location":"getting-started/prince-of-persia/#starting-dosbox-staging","title":"Starting DOSBox Staging","text":"<p>Okay, with our C drive set up and ready to go, the next step is to start DOSBox Staging from our <code>DOS Games/Prince of Persia</code> folder.

DOS has a command line interface that predates graphical user interfaces we\u2019re accustomed to from modern operating systems. We get DOS to do things by typing in commands, and if manage to do this correctly, DOS will follow our instructions to the letter (pun intended). DOS is not a multitasking operating system; you can only do a single thing in it at any given point in time.</p> <p>Let\u2019s analyse the prompt a little bit. It always starts with a letter followed by a semicolon which denotes the current drive. Right after startup, this is always the <code>Z</code> drive. This is a special drive that\u2019s always available; DOSBox stores some of its commands on it\u2014you don\u2019t need to worry about it now.</p> <p>After the semicolon is the path of the current folder or current directory in DOS terminology. This is currently the root directory of the <code>Z</code> drive as indicated by the <code>\\</code> (backslash) character. The <code>&gt;</code> character just signifies the end of the prompt, and the blinking underscore (<code>_</code>) character after it is\u2014guess what?\u2014the cursor.</p> <p>Okay, enough theory, type in <code>C:</code> and then press Enter to switch to the C drive. The prompt should now reflect that we\u2019re in the root directory of the C drive:</p> <pre><code>Z:\\&gt;c:\nC:\\&gt;_\n</code></pre> <p>Type in <code>dir</code> and press Enter to list the contents of the current directory:</p> <pre><code>C:\\&gt;dir\n Volume in drive C is CDRIVE\n Directory of C:\\\n\nPOP1     TXT                     362 07/07/1995 10:12a\nPOP1DEMO EXE                 267,420 07/05/1995  9:53a\n                2 file(s)               268,116 bytes\n                0 dir(s)            262,144,000 bytes free\nC:\\&gt;_\n</code></pre> <p>Well, that\u2019s what we put into our virtual C drive, so nothing too spectacular so far.

It turns out this is a self-extracting archive that unpacks its contents into the current directory when you run it.

There\u2019s minimal to no handholding in most DOS games from the 1980s and the 90s; you are expected to read the user manual, often there is no in-game tutorial, and the games are generally unforgiving and require a level of dedication from the player that\u2019s uncommon in more modern titles.</p> <p>However, this does not mean that these games are less fun, on the contrary!

These monitors exhibit certain characteristic peculiarities when displaying low-resolution graphics; you can think of them as \u201cbuilt-in filters\u201d that can never be disabled.

We are proud to present DOSBox Staging 0.81.0 to you, a rather substantial release containing a large number of exciting new features and improvements!</p> <p>For the first time in history, DOSBox comes with built-in authentic CRT monitor emulation that just works out-of-the-box without any manual configuration required. The VGA code has been overhauled, shortcuts and simplifications have been removed, and now we\u2019re defaulting to accurate per-scanline emulation and double scanning in all VGA, SVGA, and VESA modes. Integer scaling options have been added, it\u2019s now possible to stretch the image to fullscreen, force any arbitrary aspect ratio, or even emulate the horizontal and vertical stretch controls of CRT monitors in real time. Screenshots have been made aspect ratio correct by default, and image capturing has become multi-threaded, so it no longer causes audio hiccups and micro-pauses. Video capturing has been made about three times more performant. Oh, almost forgot: we\u2019ve also added 3dfx Voodoo 1 support for the fans of those late 90s 3D DOS games!  </p> <p>Well, that\u2019s just the video side of things. We\u2019ve added support for the ultra-rare IBM Music Feature Card, dealing with Roland MT-32 ROMs has become much easier, plus we\u2019ve made numerous MIDI-related improvements as well. Not to mention all the mouse and joystick enhancements and fixes, the addition of a few missing DOS commands, improved filesystem integration, fixing some long-standing annoying shortcomings of the FPU emulation in non-x86 builds, taking localisation support to the next level, and the list just goes on and on\u2026</p> <p>Read on to learn more, and Merry Christmas! \ud83c\udf85 \ud83c\udf81 \ud83c\udf84</p>"},{"location":"releases/release-notes/0.81.0-rc/#how-to-upgrade","title":"How to upgrade","text":"<p>Start by downloading the latest version, then make sure to upgrade your primary configuration as described below.</p>"},{"location":"releases/release-notes/0.81.0-rc/#downloads","title":"Downloads","text":"<ul> <li>Windows</li> <li>macOS</li> <li>Linux</li> </ul>"},{"location":"releases/release-notes/0.81.0-rc/#upgrading-your-primary-configuration","title":"Upgrading your primary configuration","text":"<p>Since config settings might be renamed, altered, or deprecated between releases, it\u2019s best to let DOSBox Staging write the new default primary config on the first launch, then reapply your old settings manually.</p> <p>Start by backing up your existing primary config.

It turns out this only causes a ~7% performance drop on modern hardware in benchmarks, which is not much for such a significant improvement.</p> <p>Double scanning and per-scanline rendering were available via the special <code>vgaonly</code> machine type before, but that was incompatible with VESA modes and it truncated the 18-bit VGA DAC colour output to 16-bits only, causing banding in certain scenes.

This has been flipped around: the new default is capturing images in the same aspect ratio that you see on your screen.</p> <p>Taking raw and rendered (post-shader) screenshots continues to be an option, of course. The following three image capture formats have been introduced:</p> <ul> <li> <p><code>upscaled</code> \u2014 The image is captured in the same aspect ratio you see on   the screen.

This is a rather small price to pay for aspect ratio correctness.</p> <p>Aspect ratio correctness, 2023 edition</p> <p>Fact: most 320\u00d7200 and similar low-resolution DOS games absolutely need aspect ratio correction enabled to appear correctly. While some games benefit from forcing square pixels, these only account for about 1-2% of the total DOS gaming catalogue. That\u2019s the reason why DOSBox Staging performs aspect ratio correction out-of-the-box.</p> <p>The sad reality of the situation today is that the vast majority of 320\u00d7200 DOS games are displayed in the wrong aspect ratio with square pixels on various websites and video-sharing services. Emulators that don\u2019t default to aspect ratio correct output and screen captures have undoubtedly contributed to this widespread problem. Aspect ratio correct screen captures by default is our attempt to play our part in remedying the situation, and hopefully reversing it with time.</p> <p>Raw capture breaking changes</p> <p>Previously, raw image captures width or height doubled certain DOS video modes. There wasn\u2019t much rhyme or reason to it. Now raw captures always contain the actual emulated DOS framebuffer-level image (e.g., 320\u00d7200 modes get captured as 320\u00d7200 PNG files, regardless of any other settings).</p> <p>The only exceptions are the composite CGA, PCjr, and Tandy modes. These modes are a bit special as internally they\u2019re rendered width-doubled to have enough horizontal resolution for representing composite artifacts. Therefore, we write raw image captures of composite modes width-doubled to retain all rendered information (e.g., the 640\u00d7200 composite CGA mode will result in a 1280\u00d7200 raw image, which might be surprising at first, but it\u2019s intended and correct behaviour).</p>"},{"location":"releases/release-notes/0.81.0-rc/#supercharged-image-and-video-capturing","title":"Supercharged image and video capturing","text":"<p>The optimised zlib-ng library has been added to mitigate the video capturing performance hit incurred by our new more accurate VGA emulation approach compared to 0.80.1.

This makes a huge difference on older CPUs, but even on fast modern machines, you can now capture videos at higher resolutions without glitches.</p> <p>Additionally, image capturing is now being performed in multiple background threads.

Now we\u2019re giving you not only that but an entirely new mechanism to apply arbitrary aspect ratios, zoom into the DOS content, and even emulate the horizontal and vertical stretch controls of CRT monitors of yore! </p> <p>The key element of the feature is the new <code>aspect = stretch</code> mode which stretches the image to the extents of the viewport. For example, to make a game completely fill the screen, use the following config:</p> <pre><code>[sdl]\nfullscreen = on\n\n[render]\naspect = stretch\nviewport = fit\ninteger_scaling = off\n</code></pre> <p>The second piece of the puzzle is the new <code>relative</code> mode added to the <code>viewport</code> setting (<code>viewport_resolution</code> has been renamed to <code>viewport</code> and moved to the <code>[render]</code> section). In relative mode, the viewport is a 4:3 aspect ratio rectangle fit into the window or screen as the starting point, which is then scaled by the specified horizontal and vertical stretch factors. The resulting viewport is allowed to extend beyond the edges of the window or the screen, so this can be used to \u201czoom\u201d into the image while forcing arbitrary aspect ratios.</p> <p>For example, you can aspect ratio correct lazy Hercules conversions that just reused the EGA/VGA assets and make them fill the screen better by zooming in a little.

This, however, conflicts with our revised UTF8-aware config handling, which results in the table drawing characters not being displayed correctly.</p> <p>The fix is to convert such config files from CP473 to UTF-8 encoding.
